602	9	The popularity which was accorded The Virginian indicates that Wister	realized his stated ambition	gave us an authentic account of the western experience	became the American Tolstoi	had written an account of the cowboy which appealed to American aspirations			4	1	2003-06-07 15:19:05	1	2003-07-24 16:09:32

When positive and negative charges within a cloud cannot break down the insulating properties of air, no lightning is formed.	Without hail and thunder, there could be no lightning.

628	1	When our beliefs are questioned, we are	inclined to re-examine them	usually declared in a state of war	impervious to all attacks because of infallible government dogma	most anxious to fully answer all queries	even more passionately defensive of them		5	1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-08-19 09:17:22
628	2	We defend our opinions, because	our self-esteem is threatened	they are important to us	they were difficult to attain	we are naturally passionate	we are always right		1	1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:52:24
628	3	The United States senator who stated that God could not make him change his mind	was an atheist	was antireligious	had an open mind	would probably refuse to recognize evidence of the opposite point of view	would welcome evidence that he was wrong		4	1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:52:24

628	10	Implied but not stated:	In the intellectual world, peace is without victory.	Man is not a rational animal.

629	6	According to the article, woman's absorption in clothes	constitutes a great danger to society	indirectly discourages participation-in more worth-while projects	is a source of constant dissatisfaction to a woman	saves society from more dangerous evils than those it causes	is the only satisfaction a woman gets out of life		4	1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:54:35
629	7	The author of this article believes that fashion	promotes conformity	promotes individuality	is primarily concerned with beauty	is concerned only with the clothes that are beautiful and distinctive	is an unimportant force in a woman's life		1	1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:54:35
629	8	In the author's opinion, women who follow fashions vigorously	are highly individualistic	follow their own inclinations	obey a primitive, tribal impulse	must be wealthy	are necessarily beautiful women		3	1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:54:35
629	9	According to this article, conformity in manners, morals, and literature	has no exceptions	is impossible because all artists are individualists	differs distinctly from conformity in fashions	stems from the same kind of impulses as does conformity in     fashions	occurs because people are primitive		4	1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:54:35

630	1	One can infer that the author considers Toscanini a	genius	perfectionist	flautist	tyrant	both A and B		5	1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:56:46
630	2	According to the author, a baton in the hand of Toscanini is like a	sword in the hand of a fencer	wand in the hand of a magician	whip in the hand of an angry master	ruler in the hand of a teacher	harp in the hands of an angel		2	1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:56:46
630	3	The author describes Toscanini's movements while conducting as	forceful	clear-cut	effeminate	ambiguous	both A and B		5	1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:56:46
630	4	The phrase &quot;Toscanini's vision, audible to him alone&quot; means that	people do not appreciate Toscanini's music	Toscanini was able to perceive music as it should sound ideally	no musician could interpret Toscanini's direction	most musicians play inadequately without direction	most musicians are tone-deaf		2	1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:56:46

639	8	The specialist, according to the author, may be restricted in his search for truth because	he frequently studies things of little importance	he often does not trust his own observations	his work is not accepted by the layman	he is not a writer or an artist	his small area of study is only a part of a larger whole		5	1	2003-06-07 15:19:12	1	2003-07-25 16:47:00

Can anything you tell me cause me more pain than that which I have inflicted upon myself?	Accept this as a symbol of my regard for you.

648	10	Which of the following statements is not true, according to the author?	The heliocentric concept was unknown until the Copernican revolution.	The heliocentric concept is more deflationary to the human ego than is the geocentric concept.	Heliocentrism is no longer generally accepted by astronomers.
