1	Orange	2c	9	4.5	By tagging sharks the U.S. and Wildlife Service hopes to learn more about these fish.  It wants to find out how many there are, where they live, and what baits they will take.  
   Tagging sharks takes skill.  First the shark must be hooked and then drawn alongside a boat to be tagged.  The tags, yellow plastic streamers, are attached to stainless steel arrowhead-shaped darts.  The dart is attached to the end of a six-to-ten foot pole.  The pole is thrust at the shark's hide.  Force is needed to stick the dart into the tough skin.  A sharp pull on the pole releases the dart.  The tagged shark feels little pain.				1	2002-11-08 13:57:41
2	Brown	2c	8	3.5	A man wanted to buy a mule.  But before paying for it, he took it home to try it out.  He put it in the barn with his other mules.  It made friends with the laziest, greediest mule in the barn.
   Right away the man took the mule back to its owner.  He said, &quot;I don't want this mule.  I know he'll be just like the mule in my barn that he picked for his friend.&quot;
   A <i>man is known by the company he keeps.</i>

4	Aqua	2a	1	3	Abraham Lincoln liked jokes.  He liked to laugh.  And he liked to make people think.  He could make them think with a joke.
   Once Lincoln was talking with some people.
   He asked, &quot;How many legs does a sheep have?&quot;
   &quot;Four,&quot; the people answered.
   &quot;Right,&quot; Lincoln said.  &quot;Now, how many legs does a sheep have if we call the tail a leg?&quot;
   &quot;Five,&quot; they answered.
   &quot;Wrong,&quot; Lincoln said.  &quot;It still has four legs, because calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one!&quot;		1	2002-06-19 13:15:14	1	2002-11-07 10:16:54
5	Aqua	2a	2	3	   The snow never melts on some mountains.  And at the North and South poles it stays cold all year.  Over the years snow piles up in these places.  The weight of new snow packs down the old snow.  That turns snow to ice.  The huge sheets of ice are called <i>glaciers</i>.
   As a glacier grows, its weight causes it to slide.  Mountain glaciers may slide into warm valleys and melt.  Sometimes glaciers near the sea slide into the water and melt.		1	2002-06-19 13:21:57	1	2002-07-18 15:42:06
6	Aqua	2a	3	3	   Long ago people lived in caves.  They sat and slept on the ground.  They had no tools, so they had to tear things apart with their hands and crack nuts with their teeth.  Then someone found that a sharp stone would cut.  Someone else saw that a rock would crack nuts.  These were the first tools.
   Soon people put handles on stones and rocks to make them easier to use.  From that time on, people have made new and better tools.		1	2002-06-19 13:27:51	1	2002-07-18 15:42:06
7	Aqua	2a	4	3	   Many spiders spin webs.  They use the webs to catch their food.  After a spider has made a web, it stays on the web and waits.  It waits to catch an insect.
   The silk threads of the web are sticky.  Once an insect lands on the web, it can't get away.  So the spider has caught its meal.  But if a wasp flies into a web, the spider has to look out.  It's in danger.  Some wasps like to eat spiders!		1	2002-06-19 13:32:09	1	2002-07-18 15:42:06
8	Aqua	2a	5	3	   In the 1700s Spain owned much of Latin America.  Spain tried to keep Britain from trading there.  One day a Spanish ship caught a British ship near there.
   Robert Jenkins was the captain of the British ship.  The Spanish cut off one of his ears.
   He went back to London.  He showed the people what had been done to him.  It made them angry.  They went to war with Spain.  The war is called the War of Jenkins's Ear.		1	2002-06-19 13:36:57	1	2002-07-18 15:42:06
9	Blue	2a	2	3.5	   Almost no one had heard of Billy Mills.  But the young Sioux suddenly became famous in the Olympics of 1964.
   Mills ran for the United States track team.  But he wasn't one of the best on the team.  No one else thought he could win the 10,000-meter race.  But Mills thought he could.  He told himself, &quot;I'll leave the others behind in a cloud of dust!&quot;  And he did.  Mills broke the U.S. and Olympic records.  Then people everywhere heard his name.  And some called him Chief Cloud of Dust.		1	2002-06-19 14:13:31	1	2004-06-08 15:05:02
10	Blue	2a	3	3.5	   Many shops have a revolving door.  That kind of door goes round and round.  It is like four doors in one.
   A revolving door spins on a pole.  The pole is in the middle of the four doors.  When you push one of the four doors, the pole turns in holes in the ceiling and floor.  Then the doors go round and round.  No matter how quickly the four doors spin, two doors are always closed.
   Revolving doors keep cold air out in winter and hot air out in summer.		1	2002-06-19 14:19:03	1	2002-07-05 17:36:58
11	Blue	2a	4	3.5	   A frog will eat just about any animal that can fit into its mouth.
   Small frogs eat insects and spiders.  Big frogs may eat small turtles, mice, and birds.  They even eat other frogs.
   A frog has a long, sticky tongue.  It is fastened to the front of the frog's mouth.  That way a frog can stick out its tongue quite far.
   When a frog sees an insect, it shoots out its tongue.  Pop!   The insect is caught.  It can't get away because it is stuck to the frog's sticky tongue.		1	2002-06-19 14:23:09	1	2002-07-05 17:37:08
12	Blue	2a	5	3.5	   Can you blow hard enough to lift a book?  It isn't very difficult.  You can do it if you know the secret.
   Put the book on top of a flat balloon.  Then blow into the balloon.  Up goes the book.  The balloon has lifted it.
   When you blow into a balloon, the air stays in one place.  It does not go anywhere.  It just piles up inside the balloon.  And the push of air gets stronger and stronger.  Soon the push of the air is strong enough to lift the book.		1	2002-06-19 14:27:56	1	2002-07-05 17:37:22
13	Purple	2a	2	4	   Many years ago, buildings in towns were just three or four floors tall.  There were no elevators, and that was as high as people cared to climb stairs.
   In 1853 Elisha Otis built an elevator to lift freight.  He built it so that it would not fall if its lifting rope broke.  He himself was raised on it at a fair in 1854.  He had the rope cut.  It didn't fall.  He was safe.
   Elevators were first used to lift freight and then lift people.  They made it possible for buildings to be built as high as they could go.		1	2002-06-19 14:52:29	1	2002-07-05 17:37:39
14	Purple	2a	3	4	   Rabbits have a strong sense of smell.  It warns them of danger.  They often wiggle their nose to help them pick up the scent of a hungry fox or dog.
   Rabbits have other ways to tell if danger is near.  Their eyes are on the sides of their head.  That helps them see things behind them.  They can move their long ears one at a time.  That helps them hear faint sounds at a distance.
   When rabbits do smell, see, or hear danger, they run away quickly.  They can run fast, too - about thirty kilometers (nineteen miles) an hour.		1	2002-06-19 15:13:10	1	2002-07-05 17:37:50
15	Purple	2a	4	4	   A mirror is smooth and shiny.  It bounces back the light that hits it.  When you stand in front of a mirror, light goes from you to the mirror.  It bounces off the mirror and comes back to you, showing you the way you look.
   But this &quot;you&quot; that you see in the mirror is always backwards.  And, if you stand away from the mirror, the &quot;you&quot; you see there seems twice as far away.  This is because light goes from you to the mirror and from the mirror back to you.  It goes twice the distance between you and the mirror.		1	2002-06-19 15:18:51	1	2002-07-05 17:38:01
16	Purple	2a	5	4	   When the first white men came to New Zealand, they found that the natives raised sweet potatoes.  They were surprised to hear potatoes called by the same name used by South Americans.  Six thousand miles is a long way for a name to go.
   Sweet potatoes were first grown in South America.  They are fat roots.  You see them sold in shops and growing leaves on windowsills.  They have a smooth skin; they have yellow or orange insides.
   The sweet potato has not been found growing wild.  It needs warmth; it needs good care; it bruises and spoils easily.		1	2002-06-19 15:26:06	1	2005-08-31 15:31:05
17	Violet	2a	1	4.5	   When the English explorer Captain James Cook came to Australia, he saw an unfamiliar animal.  It was about 1.8 meters (6 feet) tall.  It had a small head like a dog's.  Its nose was pointed, and its large ears stood straight up.
   Its front legs were small.  But its hind legs were large and strong.  It could hop on its hind legs at speeds of up to 64 kilometers (40 miles) an hour.  It had a thick, hairy tail about 1.2 meters (4 feet) long that helped it to stand up.
   Captain Cook asked people the animal's name.  They answered, &quot;Kangaroo,&quot; which meant, &quot;I don't know.&quot;  And so the kangaroo was named.		1	2002-06-19 15:42:20	1	2004-09-14 16:21:47
18	Violet	2a	2	4.5	   Your hair is important.  It keeps your head warm in winter.  It screens out the sun in summer.  It protects your head against bumps and bruises.
   There are some hundred thousand hairs on your head.  They grow out of tiny holes called follicles.  Follicles may be round holes, oval holes (shaped like an egg), or narrow slots.
   Round follicles bear straight hair; oval ones bear slightly curly hair; narrow ones bear very curly hair.
   Each hair matches the shape of its follicle.  Straight hairs are round; slightly curly hairs are oval; very curly hairs are flat.  A person's hair type never changes because the shape of the hair follicle never changes.		1	2002-06-19 16:22:08	1	2002-06-20 11:04:02
19	Violet	2a	3	4.5	   The idea for freezing fresh foods came from the Eskimos.  In their natural &quot;ice freezers&quot; they sometimes kept food fresh for years.  When explorers first ate this frozen food, they were surprised to find how fresh it was.
   Now we copy the Eskimos.  We freeze our vegetables, fruits, fish, and meat.  Foods that are to be frozen must first be prepared.  All are cleaned and some are cooked.  Then they are packaged by machine.  Next they are placed in freezers, which freeze them quickly.  Freezing them fast helps keep their taste fresh.
   So you can thank the Eskimos the next time you eat fresh-tasting fruit on a winter day.		1	2002-06-19 16:33:06	1	2002-06-20 11:03:42
20	Violet	2a	4	4.5	   Vicki Smith grabbed her husband's arm.  She made a quick half-turn and threw him off his feet.  She wasn't trying to hurt her husband.  She was doing her judo practice.
   Judo means &quot;gentle&quot; or &quot;gentle way.&quot;  It is a kind of wrestling.  It lets weak persons defend themselves against stronger ones.  Balance and speed are used to fight off force.
   Vicki learned the primary throws in a white belt class.  Then she went to a brown belt class.  And later she moved to a black belt class.  There she became an expert.  And she became the first black woman in the world to earn the first-degree black belt in judo.		1	2002-06-19 16:39:09	1	2002-06-20 11:03:15
21	Violet	2a	5	4.5	What acts like both a sponge and an anchor?  The roots of a plant do.
   Roots soak up water as a sponge does.  A plant's roots grow down into the earth, spreading out and sending out branches.  They grow towards damp places in search of water.
   The ground usually has lots of water in it from rain.  Mixed with the water are iron, copper, and other minerals.  Plants need minerals to stay healthy.  Roots soak up minerals along with water and send minerals to all parts of the plant.
   Roots are anchors, too.  They hold a plant tightly in place.  Winds can't blow the plant away.  Floods or rain can't wash it away.		1	2002-06-19 16:45:20	1	2007-08-25 10:35:31
22	Rose	2a	1	5	   The platypus is an animal that is found only in Australia.  It lives in burrows along the banks of streams.
   The platypus has a broad, flat bill like that of a duck; it is sometimes called a duckbill.  It has soft, thick fur, little eyes, webbed feet, and a flat tail like a beaver's.  It has long claws and no teeth.  The male platypus has a poison spur in each hind leg.
   The female platypus lays her eggs in a nest in the burrow.  For about two weeks she curls her body round the eggs to keep them warm.  After the babies hatch she makes a pouch by folding her large tail under her body.  There she keeps her babies until their fur grows.		1	2002-06-19 17:47:51	1	2002-06-20 11:01:50
23	Rose	2a	2	5	   &quot;Huelga! (strike)&quot; grape pickers shout.  They are striking for <i>la causa</i> (the cause). 
   The head of the picket line is a <i>chicana</i> (Mexican-American woman) - Delores Huerta.  &quot;Farmworkers are treated like animals,&quot; she says.  Her hands shake with anger.  &quot;Hundreds die each year after they are sprayed with insect killers.  Each year they earn $1500.  They have poor diets.
   The United Farm Workers was formed to help them.  Huerta is now first vice-president of the union.  She has helped work out contracts with the powerful grape and lettuce growers.  But she knows that much work still needs to be done.  She wants the people of the fields to have some power in their hands.  Then they can direct their own lives.		1	2002-06-19 17:55:10	1	2002-11-04 21:21:08
24	Rose	2a	3	5	   The age of cattle drives north from Texas lasted from the 1860s to the 1880s.  A drive took from two to three months, the average crew numbered eleven, and the average herd was twenty-five hundred head.
   The trail boss was either the owner of the herd, the foreman of the ranch, or a professional drover.  His word was law on the drive.
   Each of the cowhands had certain duties.  The two most experienced ones rode at the head of the herd, leading the cattle in the right direction.
   Four rode swing, two on each side of the herd.  They went after strays and kept the herd together.
   The newest hands rode drag.  They kept the stragglers at the back of the herd moving.		1	2002-06-19 18:03:14	1	2002-06-20 11:00:42
25	Rose	2a	5	5	   Long ago, people couldn't understand what thunder and lightning were.  They just saw a streak of light across the sky and heard a loud rumbling.  They decided that thunder and lightning had to be caused by a god.  People in northern Europe named this god Thor.
   They believed that when Thor was very angry, he would throw a large hammer across the sky.  That was the lightning.  While Thor was doing this, he would ride in a wagon pulled by two goats.  The sound of the wheels of the wagon was the thunder.
   In praise of Thor, these people named a day of the week after him.  They called this day <i>Thuresdaeg</i> or Thor's day.  Today, in English, we say <i>Thursday</i> instead.		1	2002-06-19 18:10:37	1	2002-06-20 11:00:16
26	Tan	2c	1	3	   Alfred the Great was born in 848.  He died in 900.  He ruled one of the strong tribes in England.  He led his tribe in the fight against the Norse invaders.  Many other tribes joined Alfred in his fight.  They knew he was a brave leader.
   He trained his men well for fighting.  And he built up England's first navy.  Now his men could meet the foe at sea as well as on land.  They drove back the Norsemen.		1	2002-06-20 09:16:17	1	2002-11-08 13:58:23
27	Olive	2c	1	5.5	   Walter Rothe is working for the adoption of his universal calendar.  His calendar has thirteen months.  Each twenty-eight-day month has four seven-day weeks.  This gives us only 364 days.  To give the year its 365 days, Rothe adds Orbit Day at the end of the year.  This day celebrates the earth's yearly trip round the sun.  Leap year has an extra holiday in summer.
   Every date of every month falls on the same day of the week.  Each month starts on Monday.  Each quarter of the year starts on Monday.  The thirteenth month is an official summer vacation.  It is called Solarius, for the sun.
   Rothe thinks his biggest opposition will come from people who print calendars.  We won't need a new one every year if his system is adopted.		1	2002-06-20 09:22:52	1	2002-06-20 10:59:44
28	Olive	2c	2	5.5	   To young girls, the thimble was once as important as a piece of jewelry.
   In America during the 1700s, thimbles were made by the silversmiths.  Usually they were made to order.  The bands below the tips of the thimbles were fashioned in shades of gold.  Some were set with diamonds, rubies, or coral.  Sometimes a motto or quotation was engraved on the band.  A few thimbles were made of glass.  But whether they were useful is doubtful.  It is certain that they were fragile.
   Today little sewing is done by hand.  And many girls will never use a thimble.  Or, if they do, it is likely to be just a plastic one.  The coming of the modern sewing machine has made the fine old thimble a collector's item.		1	2002-06-20 09:30:23	1	2002-06-20 10:59:21
29	Olive	2c	3	5.5	   The volcano called Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79.  The Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried.  The few who escaped told what had happened.
   On the fatal day, people were going about their business.  Some were shopping, some doing housework.  Then the sky grew dark; ashes began to fall.  Those who waited to find their children or to collect their valuables were trapped.  Under the lava and ash they lay as they had fallen, holding their children by the hand; their pet dogs lay nearby.  Houses stood upright; pots were on the kitchen tables; shops and public baths were ready for customers.
   Centuries later men dug through the lava and ash and found the towns.  From these towns we have learned what life was like in the first century A.D.		1	2002-06-20 09:38:40	1	2002-06-20 10:58:57
30	Olive	2c	4	5.5	   William H. Bonney - Billy the Kid - killed twenty-one men before he was twenty-one years old.  Some of the killings were murder, some self-defense.
   Billy was an expert at cards and guns by the time he was fourteen.  That's when he killed his first man; supposedly the man had bothered Billy's mother.
   He and another boy fled to Arizona.  They killed two Indians and stole their furs to start a gambling business.  The business ended when a man accused Billy of cheating.  The Kid shot him and fled.
   The Kid was caught once; he was tried and sentenced to hang.  But he killed his guards and escaped.
   Finally Sheriff Pat Garrett, who had once been Billy's friend, shot the outlaw.  The Old West's most famous killer would kill no more.		1	2002-06-20 09:52:11	1	2005-01-14 15:57:39
31	Olive	2c	5	5.5	   The pig plays an important role in the New Year's celebration in Austria.  To make sure the New Year starts off right, the Austrians provide themselves with all sorts of good-luck charms; many of these charms have the shape of curly-tailed pigs.
   On New Year's Day the Austrians eat roast pig.  For dessert they have candies made in the shape of little piglets.
   The customs concerning the pig may go back to the old days when wild boar roamed Austria.  These animals were sacrificed on New Year's Day; this was supposed to bring luck for the coming year.
   Some of the Austrians believe that because the pig moves forward as he furrows the ground with his snout, it is the best charm they could have for moving forward during the coming year.		1	2002-06-20 09:59:52	1	2002-06-20 10:56:29
32	Green	2c	1	6	   When someone in the United States speaks of Dixie, he is referring to the South.  No one is sure where this nickname for the Southern states came from.
   Some think that it came from Jeremiah Dixon.  He was one of the two men who surveyed the boundary line between Pennsylvania and Maryland.  Mason and Dixon's line later marked the dividing line between the slave states and the free states.
   Another theory is that the word came from the French word <i>dix</i> (ten). <i>Dix</i> appeared on all ten-dollar bank notes issued by the Bank of Louisiana before the Civil War.  These notes were known throughout the South as dixies.
   One theory says that the word is of Northern origin.  It has been traced back to an eighteenth century slaveholder named Dixie.  And Dixie lived in New York.		1	2002-06-20 11:33:54	1	2002-11-04 21:10:33
33	Green	2c	2	6	   On January 31, 1967, the Los Angeles newspapers headlined a newly invented word.  This word - <i>smain</i> - defined the weather that had traveled through southern California the day before.
  Smain, the papers explained, is smog mixed with rain.  The word is like the word <i>smog</i>, which had been invented years before to describe the mixture of smoke and fog.
   For years people thought that rain would wash away the smog.  But instead the heavy rain soaked the smog into smain.
   There are many possibilities for new words that describe the weather.  For instance, if there is smain, why not <i>smight</i> - night smog - too?  Then a town would be struck with smight and smain.
   Other combinations might include <i>smeet</i> - smog and sleet; <i>smunder</i> - smog and thunder; <i>hehum</i> - heat and humidity; <i>smail</i> - smog and hail; and <i>snog</i> - smog and snow.		1	2002-06-20 11:43:39	1	2007-10-19 15:26:21
34	Green	2c	3	6	   No jockey ever made a faster ride to fame than Willie Shoemaker.  The little Texan was just seventeen when he won his first race.  Before he was thirty, he had become the first jockey in history to win the national riding championship five times.  He was also the first to win two million dollars in racing purses in a single year, and the first to boot home more than 4000 winners in twelve years of racing.  A legend before his thirtieth birthday, Wee Willie - &quot;The Shoe&quot; - became the youngest jockey ever to be honored in racing's Hall of Fame.
   He achieved his greatest feat in 1953.  Until that time the most winners ridden by a single jockey in one year was 390.  But that year Willie rode 485 winners.
    Jockeys may never catch up with his record.		1	2002-06-20 11:57:09	1	2002-06-20 12:00:24
35	Green	2c	4	6	   Englishmen tell a story - and it might be true - of a nearly fatal journey that Queen Victoria made by train from London to the Scottish Highlands.
   The engineer was attempting to make up lost time.  Suddenly he saw a figure loom up on the track ahead; he jammed on the brakes. 
   The crew rushed out and discovered that fifty yards ahead a bridge had been washed out.  A few more seconds and Queen Victoria would have been killed.
   The crew looked for the mysterious figure that had saved the train, but it had vanished.  Suddenly it reappeared on the track, waving its arms.  The engineer shouted and pointed.
   Trapped in the engine's headlight was a moth.  The figure that they had seen was the shadow the moth cast on the snow as it flew closer and closer to the headlight.		1	2002-06-20 12:05:34	1	2002-06-20 12:08:47
36	Olive	2c	15	5.5	   A man I know, who owns a restaurant, told me that yesterday a horse came in, sat down, and ordered a cheeseburger.
   The restaurant owner was so surprised hat he didn't know what to say - so he fixed the sandwich and gave it to the horse.
   &quot;That will be two dollars,&quot; said the restaurant owner.  The horse looked at him strangely, but paid the money.  The restaurant owner just stared.
   Finally the horse finished eating and, as he got up to leave, he said, &quot;You've been staring at me all this time.  Do you always stare at your customers?&quot;
   &quot;Well, it isn't often,&quot; said the restaurant owner, &quot;that a horse comes into the restaurant and orders a cheeseburger.&quot;
   &quot;It's no wonder,&quot; said the horse, &quot;with the ridiculous prices you charge.&quot;		1	2002-06-20 13:14:36	1	2002-06-20 13:23:34
37	Orange	3a	1	6.5	   When a housewife wants to turn her bedroom around to face the sun, she can do it at the press of a button.  A New Zealand inventor recently perfected the world's first prefabricated revolving house.  The inventor, Peter Lester, has protected his idea by taking out a patent on it.
   The first home built to his design is in Rotorus, New Zealand.  The cost of the model is close to that of an ordinary home with the same floor space - 1800 square feet.  The main house revolves like a wheel above the basement, which remains stationary.  The plastic roof is semitransparent and softens the light.  Roof blinds in each room are controlled by an electronic system.
   The revolving house will be suitable in any climate.  In hot zones the home can turn to a shady side for coolness, or it can rotate, at one revolution every four minutes, to catch as much breeze as possible.		1	2002-06-20 15:19:56	1	2002-07-17 14:51:55
38	Orange	3a	2	6.5	   During a television play the sound man must be ready to make every sound as it is needed.  Sound effects are of three kinds: real, imitated, and recorded.
   Real sounds are those of doorbells, telephone bells, and other small objects easy to keep in a studio.  But the sound man must imitate many sounds.  For bacon frying, he crumples cellophane paper.  A long sheet of metal hanging in a doorway makes thunder.  He taps one rubber sink plunger and then another on a table to imitate a horse walking on pavement.  For a horse galloping along a gravel road, the sound man can use the two halves of a coconut, pounding each in turn very fast on the table.
   Recorded sound effects are used for noises he cannot himself produce offstage.  He plays records for such sounds as a rooster crowing, a train leaving a station, and a baby crying.
   The sound man is an important part of any television production.		1	2002-06-20 15:32:49	1	2002-07-17 14:52:12
39	Orange	3a	3	6.5	   Lake Titicaca, in the Andes mountain chain in South America, is the highest lake in the world.  And for hundreds of years the boats called balsas were the highest boats in the world.
   The balsas are made by the Aymara Indians who fish in waters more than two miles (about 12,700 feet) above sea level.  The Indians wrap totora reeds into cigar-shaped bundles and lash the bundles together.  The air trapped between the reeds makes a newly made balsa almost unsinkable.  The fisherman may stand near the narrower, higher end of this craft as he poles it along; he may sit in the small hollow amidships as he paddles.  With a favorable wind, a reed mat fastened to upright poles near the bow, or front, acts as a sail.
   Though steamboats now sail these high waters, the balsas still have one great merit.  If they are damaged, materials for repairing or replacing them are right at hand.		1	2002-06-20 15:41:24	1	2002-07-17 14:52:23
40	Orange	3a	4	6.5	   A traveler once visited a city where everyone wore blue.  Puzzled, he went to a dyer and said, &quot;Please dye this handkerchief red.&quot;
   &quot;I don't know how to dye red.&quot;
   &quot;Then dye it green.&quot;
   &quot;I can't dye it green.  There are forty master dyers in this city, and every one of us can dye only blue.&quot;
   &quot;I can dye all colors,&quot; said the traveler.  &quot;Hire me and I'll teach you my art.&quot;
   &quot;We never admit a stranger to our craft,&quot; said the dyer.
   The traveler made the same offer to the other master dyers, but none would hire him.  So he began his own dye shop.  Folks soon crowded round asking, &quot;What are all these beautiful colors called?&quot;
   He answered, &quot;This is red and that is yellow,&quot; and so on.  Everyone began bringing him cloth to dye.  When the master dyers saw this, they quickly apologized for their past insults, begging him to hire them and teach them his art.		1	2002-06-20 16:13:44	1	2002-07-17 14:52:34
41	Orange	3a	5	6.5	   People the world over tell tales of sirens and mermaids.  In Germany strange, beautiful women - only part human - are said to sit on rocks on the Rhine River, singing sweet songs.  Any man who listens to them will go out of his mind.  In Italian legends, mermaids come ashore, marry men, and bear them children.  But in time these mermaid wives desert their husbands and take their children away to the depth of the ocean.  The Chinese say the mermaids pass their time weaving.  When they weep, their tears turn to pearls.
   Despite all stories, no one has ever captured one of these strange beings - alive or dead.  A man once claimed to have found a mermaid.  The creature he displayed did indeed look half human, half fish.  But closer inspection showed that it was nothing but the head and shoulders of a dried monkey and the tail of a fish - sewn together by the cunning faker.		1	2002-06-20 16:25:56	1	2002-11-04 21:22:11
42	Gold	3a	1	7.5	   The most valuable rubbish in the world is not in the world, but in orbit around it.  Space has always contained &quot;trash&quot;; a little dust raised from Earth by air currents, cosmic ray fragments, and some cosmic dust caused by meteors.  Explosions from the sun's surface may have added some atomic nuclei, carried outward into space by the solar wind.  But there is much more trash now.  When the hatch of a space capsule opens, dust particles float out.  Sometimes small objects escape.  Astronaut Edward White's heat-reflecting glove, dropped during the first space walk, is up there.  There are several thousand fragments from upper rocket stages, some satellites that did not work, and some satellites still working.  A Titan rocket that destroyed itself added 339 pieces to the orbiting rubbish.  The millions of dollars spent to put people and objects in space makes these objects very valuable.
   Several hundred man-made objects that were space travelers have disappeared: they burned up as they reentered Earth's atmosphere.  One famous piece that returned successfully was found in the United States, when two policemen kicked it out of the middle of a street in Wisconsin.  It was a twenty-pound piece of Russia's <i>Sputnik IV</i>.		1	2002-06-20 16:40:42	1	2005-07-26 17:29:51
43	Gold	3a	2	7.5	   One of the most fearsome animals on earth is a two-inch worm.  Part of its Latin name is <i>montivindictus</i> - &quot;defender of the mountain.&quot;  Its territory is in the Himalayas of Asia, at altitudes from four thousand to six thousand feet.  People who travel in the rainy season or on a dewy night dread its attack.
   The worm is a leech - a bloodsucker.  It is drawn to its prey, human or animal, by the movement of plant stems or the vibrations of the earth.  By lengthening itself to become thinner, it can pass through eyelets in shoes or gaps between threads in socks.  Then it fastens itself to the body of its victim by a cuplike sucker.  It remains fastened after its three rows of teeth have cut slits through which blood is drawn.  A chemical produced by the leech's glands keeps the blood from clotting.
   The human victim of the leech is able to remove it, though with some difficulty.  Animals that are attacked are less fortunate.  For horses, cattle, and dogs, the result can be madness, blindness, or even death.		1	2002-06-20 16:53:35	1	2002-06-20 16:59:05
44	Gold	3a	3	7.5	   In many countries today, laws protect wildlife.  In India the need for such protection was realized centuries ago.
   About 300 B.C. an Indian writer described forests that were somewhat like national parks today.  The killing of game beasts was carefully supervised.  Some animals were fully protected.  Within the forest, nobody was allowed to cut timber, burn wood for charcoal, or trap animals for their furs.  Animals that became dangerous to human visitors were trapped or killed outside the park, so that other animals would not become uneasy. 
   The need for wildlife protection is greater now than ever before.  About a thousand species of animals are in danger of extinction, and the rate at which they are being destroyed has increased.  With mammals, for instance, the rate of extinction is now about one species every year; from A.D. 1 to 1800, the rate was about one species every fifty years.  Everywhere, men are trying to solve the problem of preserving wildlife while caring for the world's growing population.		1	2002-06-20 17:05:33	1	2002-06-20 17:10:56
45	Gold	3a	4	7.5	   A sailing ship model in a small-necked bottle is fascinating and puzzling to most landlubbers.  They wonder how anyone could ever get the ship into the bottle.
   Making ships in bottles is a traditional art.  In time past it filled the lonely hours of many a sailor on a long voyage.  The first step was to construct the ship's hull, making sure it was narrow enough to go through the neck of the bottle.  Then the sailor added the masts, spars, and other parts of the superstructure - all hinged so that they could be collapsed and later drawn upright by threads extending forward through the ship's bow.
   The sailor formed a putty &quot;sea&quot; inside the bottle and painted it with long, thin brushes.  Before this sea was dry, he inserted the ship into the bottle.  He pressed it into place.  Then he carefully pulled the various threads, raising the superstructure into position.  Finally, he sealed the tiny holes through which the threads ran, and snipped the telltale ends of thread.		1	2002-06-20 17:34:37	1	2002-06-20 17:39:58
46	Gold	3a	5	7.5	   A superstition about moles says that when a woman is frightened before the birth of her child, the child will have a mole on his body.  The mole is often supposed to have the outline of the thing that frightened the mother!  In fact, no one knows why moles appear or how to prevent them.
  The average number of moles a person has is fourteen.  Moles can appear on almost any part of the body, including the scalp.  A mole is a tissue growth.  Blood vessels, cells containing pigment, hair-follicle cells, or connective tissue can form moles.  Therefore moles can be of different types.
   As most moles never cause any health hazard, it is best to leave them alone.  But when a mole is irritated or injured, it is better to have it removed.  Moles on the soles and palms are subject to irritation.  They should be removed before the person reaches teen age.  Any mole that shows an increase in size, or a change in color, or that scales, itches, or bleeds should also be surgically removed.		1	2002-06-20 17:52:59	1	2002-06-20 18:00:48
47	Red	2c	1	4	   The toad is no contest winner when it comes to beauty.  It is brown or dark gray; it has a rough, warty skin.
   But, ugly as it is, the toad is quite a good musician.  Its pleasant trill sounds better than the songs of some birds.  And toads are helpful to man.  They eat many pests such as slugs, moths, and beetles.
   The poor toad is the subject of many myths.  For instance, it will seldom, if ever, sit on mushrooms - despite the name &quot;toadstools.&quot;  And it does <i>not</i> cause warts on the hands of people who touch it.		1	2002-06-24 08:09:52	1	2003-07-12 12:59:59
48	Red	2c	2	4	   The year 1966 was the hundredth birthday of the nickel, the five-cent coin of the United States.  It was &quot;born&quot; on May 16, 1866.
   This coin is just 25 percent nickel; it is 75 percent copper.  But nickel is a metal whose color is not changed much by copper.  So, in spite of the copper coin, it has been called a nickel since it was first used.
   But this was not the first &quot;nickel&quot; to be made by the U.S. mint.  In 1865 a coin worth three cents was made of the same metal.		1	2002-06-24 08:16:21	1	2002-06-24 08:18:45
49	Red	2c	3	4	   The pride of the German pilots of World War I was a Fokker triplane. (A triplane has three sets of wings.)  The pilots preferred this plane over all others.  It handled easily; it could climb well.
   But the plane had a few defects.  Its wings often fell off in flight.  The plane was slow; its fastest speed was 115 mph.  It didn't have much room for fuel; the plane could stay in the air for only an hour.  The machine gun was in front of the cockpit; when the pilot fired the gun, he ran the risk of shooting off his propeller.		1	2002-06-24 08:22:50	1	2002-06-24 08:25:51
50	Red	2c	4	4	   Today farmers raise nearly 200 million turkeys a year.  It's not an easy job.  Turkeys aren't very bright; they must be taught to eat or they'll starve.  They bob their heads to drink.  This puts them in a trance.  Some have drowned while drinking.
   Turkeys are nervous, too.  Noise can scare them to death.  One farmer lost sixty-six turkeys when a jet plane scared them.  He now has a radio in the turkey house.  It plays rock 'n' roll to get the birds used to noise.
  Turkeys are stupid.  And they're troublesome to raise.  But at Thanksgiving we find out why farmers bother.		1	2002-06-24 08:29:14	1	2002-06-24 08:32:10
51	Red	2c	5	4	   The largest animal ever known is nearly extinct.  It is the blue whale.  A blue whale weighs as much as thirty-five elephants; it is twice the size of the largest dinosaur that ever roamed the earth.
   At one time blue whales were protected by their size.  In the 1700s and 1800s, whaling fleets used sailing ships.  Blue whales were too large and fast for these ships.  They were passed up for smaller whales.  But the blue whale is no match for powerboats and harpoons fired from cannons.  Now less than a thousand blue whales are left in the seas.		1	2002-06-24 08:36:11	1	2002-06-24 08:39:04
52	Rose	3a	1	5.5	   Long ago a Polish monarch disappeared while hunting.  After a frantic search, his ministers found him in a nearby village.  Dressed in coarse garb, he was working as a porter.
   The courtiers could not believe their eyes.  &quot;Your majesty,&quot; said one, &quot;how can so noble a person as yourself do such vile work?&quot;
   The king replied, &quot;The heaviest bale is but a straw compared to the burden under which I labored.&quot;
   &quot;But surely Your Majesty will not continue thus?&quot; asked the startled minister.
   The king smiled and said, &quot;I have slept more in the past four nights than during my entire reign.  For the first time I am king of myself.  Elect whom you choose to be king.  It would be madness for me to return to court.&quot;

53	Rose	3a	2	5.5	   A photograph taken in the Arctic shows a polar bear that is sitting on snow with a paw shading its eyes.  But the polar bear, like most mammals, has another protection against the glare of sun shining on snow.  Each eye has a third eyelid.  These eyelids act as built-in sunglasses.
   A mammal's third eyelid is a thin, movable film or membrane.  It can spread to cover most of the eyeball.  Like the upper and lower eyelids, the membrane can protect the eye from dirt and other harmful materials as well as from too much light. 
   Man's third eyelid has largely disappeared.  Its only traces are in the inner corner of the eye.  There, a tiny fold of wet skin and a small, pinkish blob are all that remain of this membrane.		1	2002-06-24 08:56:25	1	2007-06-29 16:58:24
54	Rose	3a	3	5.5	   In summer, young cottontail rabbits can be found snuggled in fur-lined nests.  As the pink color of their skins fades and fur appears, they take on a brown-and-white pattern.  Their ears grow crisp and upright, and within a few days they learn to hop about and nibble on green sprouts.  But during the first two weeks about of third of them die.  In fact, few live longer than a year.  Their enemies - hunters, disease, harsh weather, and hostile animals - see to that.
   Cottontails usually feed during the night.  They eat herbs in the summer, and tender buds and the bark of trees and shrubs in the winter.  Because of their eating habits, it would be a tragedy if every rabbit survived.  As the plants disappeared, the soil would blow away and no new plants could thrive.		1	2002-06-24 09:12:19	1	2002-06-24 09:16:19
55	Rose	3a	4	5.5	   The young Chinese girl mixed her bread dough and left it in the sun to rise.  Then off she went for a walk with her boy friend, an Italian sailor.  When they returned they saw that the dough had risen too much.  It hung over the edge of the dish in strings, hardened by the sun.  Fearing his loved one would be punished, the sailor gathered up the signs of her neglect.
   Back at his ship he gave the pieces of dough to the cook, who added them to the soup.  Everyone thought the result was delicious - even the captain, Marco Polo.  And when Polo and his men left China in A.D. 1292 to return to Italy, they took with them news of the wonderful new food - macaroni.

56	Rose	3a	5	5.5	  At the southern tip of Japan, cherry trees burst into bloom at the end of March.  Later they begin to bloom in other parts of the country - first on the southern and then on the northern islands.
   Most cherry trees in Japan are of the <i>Somei-Yoshino</i> type, known for its brief blooming period.  The pink blossoms last ten days at the most.  They cover the whole tree with their beauty.  But even a soft breeze will shake them from the branches.  At times, cherry trees are lashed by storms.  Then the blooms fall quickly to the ground to form a wet carpet of petals.
   The people of Japan, who have a great feeling for beauty, love the cherry blossoms.  It is with a sense of sadness that they watch them fall.		1	2002-06-24 09:52:44	1	2002-06-24 09:56:39
57	Violet	3a	1	5	   A flag is more than a piece of cloth.  It stands for a nation's people - their land, history, and ideals.  Iceland's flag, for instance, stands for features of the land.  Red is for the fire of Iceland's volcanoes.  White is for ice.  Blue is for the mountains.  On India's flag, the blue wheel stands for peace and progress.  The white stripe behind it is for truth.  The black stripe on the flag of Malawi stands for the Negro people of that African land.  The red stripe represents the blood they shed to free themselves from foreign rule.
   When the people of any nation see their flag flying, they feel proud.  They love and honor the flag as a symbol of their country.		1	2002-06-24 10:55:56	1	2002-06-24 10:59:25
58	Violet	3a	2	5	   In 1889 all Paris admired the Eiffel Tower.  It was the engineering wonder of the world.  Alexandre Gustave Eiffel had completed his masterpiece in steel.
   Steel as a building material was then still new.  The 984-foot tower was a lacy network of girders.  There were thousands of steel pieces.  Two and a half million rivets joined them.
   From four corners, the legs of the tower slope inward.  They rise to form the spire.  Lifts carry visitors to three platforms at different heights.  On a clear day, countryside sixty miles off is viewed from the top platform.
   As Eiffel planned, his structure is a landmark of Paris.  It is even higher today.  A relay station for radio and television has added almost fifty feet to the tower.

   The llama is large and has long, soft hair.  It is used as a pack animal in South America because it can carry heavy loads safely over narrow mountain tracks.  It is tame, but it can be stubborn and bad-tempered.  When angry, it spits.  If you see a llama curling its big lips, move away as quickly as you can!

   How do you think the people solved their problem?  They built a mountain - from the ground up!  When finished, it stood 300 feet high.  A T-bar was set up to take skiers to the top.  From there they could ski down the quarter-mile main run of the 50-meter ski jump.
   And so athletes from all over Canada went to Saskatoon to take part in the games.  They swam.  They played badminton and other indoor games.  They boxes and wrestled.  And they skied!		1	2002-06-24 11:19:07	1	2002-11-05 08:41:44

   Some brown rats live with man all the time, others only some of the time.  Still others never live with man at all.  In summer many rats move from buildings to hedges, rabbit warrens, and riversides.  Large numbers return inside in the autumn.  Rats often move with the seasons between field and farm.  Small parties of rats can often be seen at such times.  Mass movements are less common, but have been observed after fires or floods.		1	2002-06-24 11:27:03	1	2004-07-29 13:44:03
62	Gold	2c	1	5	   Taps is music that almost everyone knows.  To a soldier it means &quot;lights out&quot;; to a camper it may mean the same thing.  It is sometimes played to signal the close of a school day.
   The bugle call is said to have been written during the Civil War.  The credit for it is given to General Daniel Butterfield.  He thought the old &quot;lights out&quot; call was too formal.  One evening in 1862 he called his bugler to his tent and gave him an envelope.  It had seven bars of music written on it.  The general asked the bugler to play those notes for the last call of the day.

   The village formed a strong fort.  It was built on many levels.  Each level was connected with the others by stone stairways.  There were stone aqueducts that carried water to pools outside the homes. 
   The walls of each house were made of stone blocks.  The Incas cut these stone blocks with nothing but their small stone tools.  The roofs of the homes were probably made of grass.  Surrounding the homes were terraces and planted gardens.		1	2002-07-05 17:58:09	1	2002-07-05 18:01:30

   The problem is a maze of tunnels forty feet beneath the streets of downtown Chicago.  The maze of tunnels was built in 1909.  Electric trains ran through the tunnels.  They hauled coal to  buildings and hauled out ashes and trash.
   Then most of the downtown stores switched from coal heat to gas or oil.  This took all the business away from the tunnel system.
   The trains are gone now, but the tunnels are still there.  And Chicago would like to find some use for them.		1	2002-07-05 18:04:40	1	2002-07-05 18:07:43

   One bird, the arctic tern, flies almost 22,000 miles each year.  It nests in the arctic regions of North America.  Early in the fall it crosses the ocean.  It skims the western shores of Europe and Africa, then crosses the ocean again to the tip of South America.  From there it flies to the edge of the Antarctic.

Today's dragon is really just a lizard.  It is found in the East Indies and southern Asia.  It's called a dragon because it has wide wings.  But, even counting its long tail, it is just eight inches in length.  Harmless and shy, it eats only insects.
   Its wings, though large, do not help it fly.  It can only glide from one tree to another.  Its wings are a beautiful color.  And the dragon - a monster in legend - is sometimes mistaken for a butterfly as it glides gracefully from tree to tree.		1	2002-07-06 11:53:09	1	2002-07-06 11:56:12
67	Brown	3a	1	8	   No two cars, even of the same make, sound exactly alike.  One may have a noisy fan belt and a creak in the rear spring; another, a tick in the engine and a rattle in the glove compartment.
   Every submarine also has its own &quot;noise signature.&quot;  Masses of machinery fill the hull of a modern submarine: there are pumps circulating the coolant around the reactor or maintaining oil and water pressures; there are the hydraulic and air-conditioning systems.  Added to their sounds are the hum of electronics, the buzz of electric motors, even the faint whirr and rattle of the refrigerator in the crew's galley.
   Various instruments can pick up these complex noises.  One device, &quot;dipped&quot; into the sea by a helicopter and held steady, probes the underwater world for several miles.  Then it is winched up and flown to another search area.
   As distinctive as a fingerprint, a noise signature can serve to identify its owner.  In Great Britain, the Royal Navy collects these signatures.  It knows the sounds of its own submarines and those of its allies.  It probably has a collection of &quot;unknowns&quot; - which may well be top secret.		1	2002-07-10 14:17:32	1	2002-07-10 14:23:09
68	Brown	3a	2	8	   Like many young Norwegians who escaped the German occupation of their country during World War II, Corie found his adventures complicated by language.  On his way to the coast, he was stopped by a German patrol.
   &quot;They couldn't speak Norwegian,&quot; he recalled, &quot;and I couldn't speak German.  But both the patrol leader and I knew a little English.  So, standing on Norwegian soil, I was questioned in English by a German officer, and gave my replies in English.&quot;
   The replies must have been satisfactory, because he was allowed to proceed.  There were still a few British soldiers hiding in Norway at the time.  The night Corie escaped in a fishing boat, he managed to take two of them along.
   The trio was picked up in the North Sea by a British destroyer.  When its officers discovered Corie had rescued two British soldiers, they feasted him royally - until he felt he couldn't eat another bite.  But the officers pressed another helping on him.  It was then that Corie's English finally let him down.
   &quot;Thank you, gentlemen,&quot; said he, to the consternation of his polite hosts, &quot;but I am already fed up.&quot;		1	2002-07-10 14:34:04	1	2002-07-10 15:20:15
69	Brown	3a	3	8	   How long does a whale live?  For years scientists have been on the lookout for some feature of the whale's anatomy that might give the answer.
   The baleen plates of the plankton-feeding whales give some indication of age.  These bony plates in the mouth, which allow only the small organisms called plankton to be swallowed, have exceedingly fine ridges.  The ridges are so arranged that they show annual growth zones.  Unfortunately, the edges of the plates wear away with time, and the year-by-year record of the whale's life becomes incomplete.
   Recently scientists discovered the feature they had been looking for.  The life record of a whale has been found in a most unexpected part of its anatomy - its ear.  Superimposed upon the eardrum of the plankton-feeding whale is a long, waxy plug.  When a longitudinal section of this was examined, it was seen to consist of a series of layers.  These are now shown to be formed annually.
   This permanent record has enabled scientists to answer the old question.  Though the answer may be revised as scientific study goes on, the known lifespan of the greatest of our mammals is said to be fifty years.		1	2002-07-10 15:59:36	1	2002-07-10 16:06:59
70	Brown	3a	4	8	   When a wolf decides to go after big fish he jumps into one of the larger channels and wades upstream, splashing mightily as he goes and driving the pike ahead of him into progressively narrower and shallower channels.  Eventually the fish realizes its danger and turns to make a dash for open water, but the wolf stands in its way.  One quick chop of those great jaws is enough to break the back of even the largest pike.
   Wolves also catch suckers when these sluggish fish are making their spawning runs up the tundra streams, according to Ootek, an Eskimo who has observed much.  The wolf's technique in this case is to crouch on a rock in a shallow section of the stream and snatch up the suckers as they pass - a method rather similar to that employed by bears when they are catching salmon.
   Another, although minor, source of food consists of arctic sculpins: small fish that lurk under rocks in shoal water.  The wolves catch these by wading along the shore and turning over the rocks with paws or nose, snapping up the exposed sculpins before they can escape.		1	2002-07-10 16:14:34	1	2002-07-10 16:23:13
71	Brown	3a	5	8	   The first recorded lighter-than-air manned flight was made in France in the eighteenth century.  Pilatre de Rozier used a homemade linen balloon filled with hot air.  His flight lasted twenty-three minutes.
   A modern balloon is constructed of nylon silk.  The wicker gondola is designed to carry a pair of balloonists, one of whom should be a qualified pilot.
   A propane gas burner is fastened above the heads of the riders.  It heats air, which rises into the balloon to maintain it aloft.  The air inside the balloon is about a hundred degrees warmer than that outside.  Two levers in the gondola regulate the burner, thus controlling the amount of air that expands and rises.  Another lever opens the top of the bag, allowing the hot air to escape and the balloon to descend.
   Getting the seemingly unwieldy craft into the air is simple.  The skilled balloonist knows how to utilize the merest puff of wind to get airborne.  But while the pilot can ascend or descend by playing the levers, he has little or no control over where he is going horizontally.  This aspect of flight depends on the wind.		1	2002-07-10 16:30:14	1	2002-07-10 16:36:50
72	Tan	3a	1	9	   An unusual competition known as the Northern Games takes place annually at Inuvik in the Northwest Territories of Canada, close to the Arctic Ocean.
   The women's events are contests in such everyday skills as boiling tea, cooking fish, making bannock, lighting fires, skinning muskrats and seals, preparing dry fish, and sewing, as well as throwing balls and hoops.
   With a typical northern flavor, the men's contests include such events as arm pulling, harpoon throwing, the Alaskan high kick, and drum dancing.  The record for the high kick is 8 feet 2 inches.  The blanket toss is popular; contestants are tossed as high as fifty feet in the air by twenty men heaving a sealskin blanket.
   The contest for introducing a new game was won one year by a skydiver, the only one in the North.  Several times he jumped over the games site, trying to land in an outstretched sealskin blanket.  Once he came within four feet of his target.  Another time, when a sudden gust of wind blew his parachute off course, he dented the roof of a car a quarter of a mile away.
   Most of the contestants and thousands of spectators are Indians and Eskimos, some coming over a thousand miles by plane and boat, to take part in the events.		1	2002-07-10 16:44:38	1	2002-07-11 09:41:12
73	Tan	3a	2	9	   Every year a million tons of oil are spilled, leaked, or deliberately flushed into the sea.  Oil contamination is a critical problem for science to solve.
   Remedies for getting rid of oil are many.  Straw absorbs four times its weight in oil.  Flamethrowers burn oil off.  Sand, talc, and chalk effectively break it up and sink it.  Various chemicals disperse the slick into droplets and enable microbes to destroy the oil more quickly.
   Some chemicals, however, become more poisonous than the oil itself when they combine with it.  In 1967, when the tanker <i>Torrey Canyon</i> grounded off Cornwall in southwest England, powerful chemicals did more lasting harm than the oil itself.  Though the oil killed thousands of birds as it floated ashore, the detergents used to clean the rocks and beaches destroyed many more creatures and upset the usual balance of marine life.
   Masses of oil reaching shore are fortunately rare, but few beaches have escaped contamination by oil.  Some ships do not report spillage, and others discharge oily wastes at night and depart.  To find the culprits, oil companies are considering a process involving the electronic analysis of oil.  This would make it possible to match any spill with its source and so identify the tanker responsible.		1	2002-07-10 16:59:46	1	2006-02-22 17:00:00
74	Tan	3a	3	9	   In 1931 a single race at Havre de Grace, in Maryland, made more than a million dollars for one man and his gambling friends.  Peter Barrie had dyed a good racehorse to look like a horse with a poor record.  The ringer won the race by four lengths - at odds of 52 to 1!
   Barrie's swindles at American racetracks led detectives of the famous Pinkerton Agency to work out a horse-identification system suggested by an official of the Jockey Club.
   The Pinkerton system has collected information on about thirty thousand racehorses.  The system requires a complete description of the animal: color markings, disposition, and other characteristics.  A number assigned to it is tattooed on the inner upper lip and entered on the record.  Six photographs are taken: front, side, and close-ups of the horse's four &quot;nighteyes,&quot; the scaly, hardened skin on the inner side of the leg.  The surface of the nighteyes is made up of distinct ridges and impressions and, like the markings on the human finger, never changes.
   Before races are run, operatives at the track use the records to check the horses entered.  No horse is allowed to run if a discrepancy remains unexplained.  Where the identification system is used, it has virtually wiped out the ringing rackets on American tracks.		1	2002-07-10 17:35:18	1	2002-11-04 21:22:50
75	Tan	3a	4	9	   In the past, when people lived in small, isolated tribes, each man had a personal name only.  As the population increased, the tribal name was added to the personal name.  When sheer numbers made this identification useless, a man might take the name of a celebrated ancestor.
   Chroniclers record that when Brian Boru became king of Ireland in the eleventh century, he sought to end the confusion by royal ordinance that established his subjects' surnames.
   The first Irish surnames were formed by putting the Gaelic word <i>ua</i> (pronounced <i>o</i>) before the personal name of a paternal ancestor, generally the grandfather.  <i>Ua</i> means &quot;descended from&quot;; thus the surname of a man descended from Flann (red) was O'Flann.
   A man's personal name described his appearance, as with the red-haired Flann; or it came from physical traits like strength, as in Mahon (the bear); or it indicated occupation, as in Magowan, from the Gaelic <i>gow</i> meaning blacksmith.  Murphy was a sea warrior, Sullivan keensighted, and Kennedy helmeted.
   If a man admired his father more than his grandfather, he attached the prefix <i>mac</i> (son) to his father's name.  Later, Norman invaders introduced the prefix <i>fitz</i> from the French <i>fils</i> (son).
   Brian Boru passed on his own name to more descendants than any other Irish hero.  The fifty thousand O'Briens in Ireland, America, and elsewhere can all claim to be descended from Brian.		1	2002-07-10 17:50:30	1	2002-07-11 09:41:35
76	Tan	3a	5	9	   Legend attaches a romantic story of true love to two magnificent snowcapped volcanoes in Mexico - Popocateptl (poh-poh-kah-TAY-pet-l) and Iztaccihuatl (Iss-ta-SEE-hwat-l).
   According to the story, Popo was a warrior who loved Iztaccihuatl, the beautiful daughter of an Indian king.  The king declared that, to win his daughter, Popo would have to prove his valor.  So Popo went off to battle, swearing to return victorious.  Iztaccihuatl made a vow that if he were killed she would commit suicide.
   Alarmed, the king sent two messengers after Popo.  When they returned with word that he had died, the princess put on a bridal veil and disappeared.
   Some months later Popo returned.  He hadn't been killed after all, just severely wounded.  Setting out to find his loved one, he searched for several years, scouring all the valleys and pueblos of Mexico.
   Finally Indian scouts told Popocateptl they had seen a woman reclining on a mountain.  Popo climbed the mountain and, at the top, found Iztaccihuatl - asleep forever.  In grief he withdrew to a distance, knelt down, and kept perpetual watch over her until he too died.
   Today the two lovers appear as mountains.  Popocatepetl, the loftier of the two, stands guard over the lower, flatter Iztaccihuatl, who is still reclining as her lover found her many years ago.		1	2002-07-11 09:24:09	1	2002-07-11 09:41:24
77	Lime	3a	1	10	   Millions of people suffer from persistent irrational fears that doctors and psychiatrists call phobias - from the Greek <i>phobos</i>, meaning fear.   The phobic person reacts to the cause of his fear with one or more physical changes, such as nausea and heart palpitations, accompanying his panic.
   Psychiatrists think phobias may sometimes stem from a single intensely frightening or painful incident, but usually from a series of less disturbing situations.  Most of us overcome the phobias we pick up, ordinarily because we have to.  If you're terrified of flying but must often do so, you'll probably suffer through the first few flights and gradually recover.  The traditional belief that an aviator who has crashed should fly again as soon as possible corresponds well to current scientific theories of how to overcome phobias.  One sufferer from a flying phobia recovered after several sessions with a hypnotist.
   An irrational fear can develop over almost any object or situation.  The number of possible phobias in our technological age exceeds the number of Greek-derivative words available.  Between <i>acrophobia</i> (fear of high places) and <i>zoophobia</i> (fear of animals), a dictionary already has many entries for specific fears.  A medical dictionary records <i>triskaidekaphobia</i>, the fear of the number 13, which has eliminated floor 13 and room 13 from some hotels, high-rise dwellings, and skyscrapers.  And not least among the phobias there is <i>phobophobia</i>, the fear of fear itself.		1	2002-07-11 09:42:29	1	2002-07-11 09:50:37
78	Lime	3a	2	10	   In the world of the gourmet, both black and white truffles remain so rare and costly that these relatives of the mushroom might still be called the &quot;diamonds of gastronomy,&quot;  although they resemble lumps of coal and wizened, unpeeled potatoes.  In the United States black truffles can cost up to fifty dollars a pound, while Italian white truffles - &quot;the pearls of the kitchen&quot; - often command twice that price.
   There are over thirty European species, usually found approximately three feet underground near the roots of scrub oaks.  For centuries poodles were trained to find these fungi, and dachshunds to unearth them.  In Italy today many breeds of dogs attend a &quot;truffle-snuffler&quot; school where they learn to find truffles.  In Sardinia goats are used, but the long-standing favorite everywhere is the pig, whose natural appetite leads it instinctively to the nearest location.  A leather thong is fastened around the pig's mouth to prevent the pig from swallowing the truffles.
   The world's leading truffle experts are the Urbani family, who gather millions of truffles annually from their Italian estate.  Five hundred workers uncover twenty thousand pounds each year: three-quarters of this amount is graded, peeled, and vacuum-packed for export.
   Truffles have long been considered a food fit for a god.  Although it is said no one has ever satisfactorily described their taste, no matter how they are prepared, truffles remain one of the world's most savory and unusual delicacies.		1	2002-07-11 10:56:15	1	2002-07-11 11:05:54
79	Lime	3a	3	10	   The qualities that make a Stradivarius superior to fine modern violins are so subtle that the average listener cannot detect them.  Yet concert artists say that Strads have an unmatched tonal quality and that they respond more quickly and easily to the touch than modern violins.
   An estimated 600 to 650 remain of the more than 1200 stringed instruments that Antonio Stradivari and his two sons made between 1666 and 1737 in Cremona, Italy.  Most were violins, although Stradivari also made violas and violincellos, and even a guitar and a harp.  Originally sold for around 120,000 lire (a substantial sum at that time), today they are worth from fifty to six hundred times that much, depending on kind and condition.
   The world's greatest violinists - among them Yehudi Menuhin, Fritz Kreisler, Mischa Elman, and Jascha Heifetz - have used Stradivariuses.
   Stradivari's secrets died with him and his sons.  Repeated attempts have been made to copy Strads and to pass them off as genuine.  But various telltale signs in the workmanship - for example, the way the wooden pegs are inserted and the ornamentation - reveal the copies to experts.  The varnish, too, is a distinctive characteristic of a Stradivarius; it ranges in shade from orange to deep reddish-brown.  Although the superb tone of a Stradivarius cannot be duplicated, the secret is thought to lie in the wood and varnish used.		1	2002-07-11 11:12:21	1	2002-07-11 11:20:39
80	Lime	3a	4	10	   Radio amateurs, or hams, can communicate with each other by voice if they speak the same language, or by special signals in international Morse code, from their own homes - on apparatus they have usually built or assembled themselves.
   When the radio amateur sits down to his transmitter and receiver to operate for a few hours, he never knows exactly what will happen.  He may first have a few friendly chats with amateurs in his own country.  Some he may be contacting for the first time; others may be amateurs who have been &quot;worked&quot; before and with whom regular schedules have been arranged.  Following this there may be an opportunity to pass the time of day with a weather observer on some remote Pacific island, or with a missionary in a country thousands of miles away.  The ham may suddenly be asked to relay a message for assistance for a town being struck by a hurricane.  He may even exchange signals with members of a polar expedition.
   Almost anyone can become a radio amateur - regardless of previous training and experience.  Hams come from all walks of life.  Many are high-school age or younger.  All that is needed is a sincere interest and a willingness to put some effort into learning the required skills.  Many amateur radio clubs offer free courses where a newcomer can learn to send and receive Morse code and can acquire the knowledge of basic electronics necessary to qualify as a ham radio operator.		1	2002-07-11 11:31:53	1	2002-07-11 11:38:37
81	Lime	3a	5	10	   Absolute pitch is frequently referred to as perfect pitch.  Possessors of this faculty are able to identify any musical note or series of notes that they hear - without direct reference to an instrument or printed music.  They may also have the ability to reproduce any given note without any aid but their own highly accurate sense of the note's pitch (the frequency at which the note's sound waves vibrate).
   Some people suggest that perfect pitch is nothing more than an acutely developed form of memory.  Many instrumentalists are able, for instance, to fix in their minds the note to which they are accustomed to tune their instruments.  But the ability to hold in the &quot;inner ear&quot; a complete range of musical pitches is not necessarily connected with the ordinary powers of memory.
   Absolute pitch occurs comparatively rarely even among musicians.  Relatively few of the great classical composers have possessed the faculty.  Anyone possessing it does have a natural endowment that would aid him greatly in becoming a musician or singer, although in certain instances such a gift could be a positive disadvantage.  For example, if a person with perfect pitch were singing with a choir or other group whose pitch dropped, he would have to mentally transpose the written notes in order to stay in tune with the other singers.		1	2002-07-11 11:45:29	1	2002-07-11 11:51:26
82	Green	3a	1	11	   &quot;Pressure of opinion a hundred years ago brought about the emancipation of the slaves.  It is now for man to insist upon the same freedom for his mind as he has won for his body.&quot;  So wrote Peter Benenson in 1961 when he founded Amnesty International to lobby for the release, or at least the trial, of the 250,000 political prisoners locked up for their beliefs by governments around the world.
   In its first ten years, Amnesty was involved in the release or relief of about twenty-five hundred political prisoners.
   Nine hundred groups of heterogeneous individuals, mostly in northern Europe, are the core of Amnesty.  Their principal work is the undramatic and painstaking one of flooding government mailboxes with postcards.
   A London-based International Secretariat coordinates twenty-seven national sections and feeds the groups with its research on prisoners reported by families, friends, or newspapers.  Each group adopts three prisoners, from countries of different political persuasions.  Any prisoner of conscience who has not advocated violence may be adopted.  The groups may send letters to the prisoner, money to his family, or telegrams to the government concerned.
   One group in England holds public meetings addressed by former prisoners in the hope of educating public opinion as well as helping to relieve the plight of their adopted prisoners.  Of the nine prisoners this group has adopted, seven have been released.
  Amnesty is now substantial enough to have gained consultative status with the United Nations, UNESCO, and the Council of Europe.		1	2002-07-11 12:39:03	1	2002-07-11 12:46:45
83	Green	3a	2	11	   Most people assume that color blindness is only an inability to see red and green properly.  This assumption greatly oversimplifies the condition, which is usually an inherited abnormality but is sometimes the result of disease.
   In normal color vision, any color a person sees can be identically matched or reproduced in the brain by a mixture of the three primary colors of light - red, green, blue.  Proportions needed to match any given color of the spectrum are constant.  This normal vision is call trichromatism (Greek <i> chroma</i>, color).
   People affected by color deficiency (perhaps a better term than color blindness) make up about 8 1/2 percent of the population - 8 percent male, 1/2 percent female.  They may be divided into three main categories with several subdivisions.
   Monochromats, those affected by the worst of the color deficiencies, see everything as a variation of one color.  Dichromats match any color with a mixture of two primary colors.  Anomalous trichomats mix the three primary colors but somehow alter the proportions used by the trichromat with normal color vision.  Among the subgroups of dichromats and anomalous trichromats, that lacking green perception is the largest.  Most dichromats and anomalous trichromats suffer little from their abnormality.  Because it has been with them from birth, they have learned to recognize things by brightness rather than hue.
   The term <i>color blindness</i> is usually an exaggeration.  The achromatic or truly color-blind person is rare.   But the problem of color deficiencies is much more complicated than &quot;red looks green and green looks red.&quot;		1	2002-07-11 12:54:29	1	2002-07-11 13:04:16
84	Green	3a	3	11	   A city of the future - where there will be no housing shortage, no unemployment, no pollution, and plenty of good schools, efficient transportation, fruit trees, and gardens - is under construction near Anchorage, Alaska, only a few miles from the Arctic Circle.
   The temperature-controlled, indoor city will be the headquarters for oil exploration and development of Alaska's north slope, and will provide housing for the expected influx of residents, estimated ultimately to number fifty thousand.
   A huge power plant, which will operate with natural gas from the oil reserves, will provide heat for the entire city.  The temperature will never fall below 68 degrees.  People will stroll in comfort in the glass-enclosed streets while their neighbors in nearby Anchorage suffer at thirty below zero.
   The wonder city will be connected with Anchorage by high-speed monorail, while interior transportation will be via minirail and electric taxis.  Automobiles will be left near Anchorage.
   The primitive beauty of the surrounding area will be left almost untouched to provide a satisfying natural environment for hiking, fishing, and other outdoor activities.  Lakes on the site will be for sailboats and canoes.  If people want to go into the wilderness, they will have to go on skis or snowshoes.  No snowmobiles or motorboats will be allowed.
   The $7,200,000 purchase of Alaska from Russia, which was arranged in 1867 by U.S. Secretary of State William Seward, was called Seward's Folly.  In contrast, the name of the futuristic Alaskan city is Seward's Success.		1	2002-07-11 13:11:29	1	2002-07-11 13:19:25
85	Green	3a	4	11	   The Mounties!  All over the world these words evoke the image of dashing officers, dressed in scarlet, urging their dog teams across Canada's vast North in pursuit of criminals and renegades.  Based on history and immortalized in literature, this image persists even to the present.
  Today, however, the duties of most Mounties are quite different.  Although formed in 1873 to stop the illegal trade in whisky and establish order in Canada's Northwest, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police now enforces federal laws in all parts of the country and provincial laws in all provinces except Ontario and Quebec.  Making use of the most modern crime-detection equipment and vast networks of communications, the RCMP maintains a criminal investigation division, a narcotics division, and a security and intelligence division; it also enforces Canada's excise and customs laws.  Through close links with Interpol, the Mounties can contact police and trace criminals in many other countries.
   Today's Mountie is a well-trained, highly educated specialist and is more apt to be found working in one of the force's five criminal investigation laboratories or engaging in other duties in one of Canada's large cities than sledding through the Arctic Circle.  The patrolling of the North does remain an important duty for some officers, but dogsleds have long since given way to aircraft and snowmobiles.  The Mounties now use horses only in their famous Musical Ride and the scarlet tunics, which identify the force in the popular mind, only on ceremonial occasions.		1	2002-07-11 13:26:13	1	2003-03-12 18:33:22
86	Green	3a	5	11	   In 1900 the Greek government organized the first underwater archaeological expedition in history.  A diver looking for sponges near Antikythera, an islet northwest of Crete, had found huge statues on the sea floor.
   One extraordinary find enabled archaeologists to date the wreck and gave new knowledge of ancient Greek scientific technology.  Inscriptions on a few insignificant pieces of corroded metal caught the eye of Valerios Stais, an archaeologist at the Greek National Museum.  He recognized the fragments as pieces of a mechanism.  The forms of the letters inscribed were later identified as those of the first century B.C.
   Most archaeologists agreed the object was an astronomical device, but calcified material and corrosion concealed so much detail that its use was uncertain.  Fifty-five years passed before British archaeologist Derek de Solla Price began assembling the pieces.  The result was spectacular and surprising.
   The object was an astronomical computer, a clocklike mechanism used to calculate the motions of the stars and the planets.  It consisted of a box with dials on the outside and a complex assembly of gears within.  According to the archaeologist, this Greek computer must have been the ancestor of all clockwork.  Similar astronomical computers were described by Arab astronomers as early as A.D. 1000.  Apparently they learned about them from Greek writings and passed the idea along to Europe at the time of the Crusades.
   Until the discovery of the Antikythera computer, no one would have believed that the ancient Greeks had reached such an advanced level of scientific technology.		1	2002-07-11 13:43:07	1	2002-10-19 13:17:36

 The groups would make up angry songs about each other. Then the groups would meet. They would sing songs at each other. Judges would decide whose songs were the angriest. That group would win. 
 It might take the judges a long time to decide. So the songs could go on for days. 		1	2002-11-06 08:35:51	1	2004-07-19 16:33:39
98	Aqua	2a	12	3	   Some deaf people can't hear sounds well. Others can't hear any sounds at all. It is difficult for people who are born deaf to learn to speak. Some learn to &quot;talk&quot; with their hands. They use their fingers and hands to show letters and words. In this way they can talk with those who know what the hand signs mean.
 At first people may be slow using their hands for sign language. But after a while they learn to &quot;talk&quot; very fast. 		1	2002-11-06 08:35:51	1	2003-02-18 11:01:36
99	Aqua	2a	13	3	   A long time ago Si-Ling-Shi lived in China. She liked to walk in her garden. She would watch caterplliars spin thread. She saw them wind the thread round their bodies. They made cocoons, small cases.
 She pulled some cocoons off a tree. She put them in water. Then she pulled the shining thread out of them. She made cloth from the thread. It was the most beautiful cloth people had seen. She had found the secret of making silk. 		1	2002-11-06 08:35:51	1	2003-02-25 15:14:50
100	Aqua	2a	14	3	   Sand glasses are used to keep time from a few seconds to a few hours.  
 They are made of two pieces of glass that are called bulbs. The bulbs look like cones. They are joined by a small tube of glass. The top bulb holds dry sand. The narrow glass tube allows sand to run into the bottom bulb in a given time.
 Sand glasses have been used since early times. They are now mainly used to time the cooking of eggs. 		1	2002-11-06 08:35:51	1	2003-02-20 16:00:59
101	Aqua	2a	15	3	   The tip of a match is rubbed on a surface that is rough, not smooth. The match tip flames at once. When two things are rubbed together, they become hot. But some things can be rubbed together for a long time and not flame. They will become hot, but they won't burn. The tip of a match needs only a little heat to make it burn. It does not have to be scratched more than once or twice to make it flame. 		1	2002-11-06 08:35:51	1	2003-02-20 16:03:48
102	Blue	2a	6	3.5	   In the mountains of Tibet, some people live in yurts. A yurt is a kind of tent. It has a frame of tree branches that is covered with a heavy cloth called felt. Felt is made from the hair of a yak. A yak is a big animal with long hair. It looks something like a buffalo.
   To make felt the yak hair is first spread on the ground. Then it is wet, made flat, and rolled until the hairs stick together. When it forms one strong piece, it is called felt. 		1	2002-11-06 08:35:52	1	2005-10-20 18:02:49
103	Blue	2a	7	3.5	   Once there were no clocks. But people could tell the time. They looked at the sun. Moving across the sky from east to west, it showed the time of day.
   Sometimes people stuck a stick in the ground. &quot;The stick made a shadow. When the sun moved across the sky, the shadow moved too.
   Later this became a land clock called a sundial. It was a flat circle with numbers round the edge. The shadow of a stick in the middle fell on the numbers and told the time. 		1	2002-11-06 08:35:52	1	2005-05-09 12:42:57
104	Blue	2a	8	3.5	   As she grew up, Clara Barton often heard her father's tales. He told of the sick and hurt soldiers in the American Revolution. She had a dream. She would find ways to help people.
   When she was eighteen, she became a teacher. Then she started her own school. It gave free schooling. Then came the Civil War. She nursed soldiers. She also helped families find 20,000 soldiers lost in the war.
   In 1881 she formed the American Red Cross. It helped those in fires and floods. She died when she was 91. 		1	2002-11-06 08:35:52	1	2003-02-06 14:14:53

   One kind of mother bird makes her nest inside a tree trunk. She stays inside, and the father bird fills the opening with mud. When the mud dries it is hard. Now the mother bird is safe to lay her eggs.
  The father bird has left a small hole in the mud door. He feeds her through it. 		1	2002-11-06 08:35:52	1	2004-03-27 12:59:58
106	Blue	2a	11	3.5	   People lived in caves long ago. There was no money. There was no need for it. In those days each group of people found its own food. They hunted animals for meat and for warm skins to wear.
 As time went on people learned to make tools. Some people were better at making tools than at hunting. So they traded tools for food and other things. This meant that each person could do the kind of work she or he did best. And people could trade (or barter) for what they needed. 		1	2002-11-06 08:35:52	1	2003-02-20 16:05:25

 In 1815 an American sea captain took an elephant home on his ship. Her name was Old Bet. The captain's brother, Mr. Bailey bought her. He showed her in farmers' barns. People paid to see her. Mr. Bailey and Old Bet walked from place to place. They traveled at night. Mr. Bailey didn't want anyone to get a free look!
 He made money. So he bought more animals. Then he added clowns to his show. Then other acts. The first traveling circus in America was on the road!  		1	2002-11-06 08:35:53	1	2003-02-25 15:17:02
108	Blue	2a	14	3.5	   A ramp may look like only a slanted surface to you. But many people call it a machine because it helps us lift things more easily.
 Prove it by making yourself a ramp. Put one end of a board on a chair seat and the other end on the floor.
 Now fill a small box with stones. Pick up the box in your hands and lift it up to the chair seat. Then push the box up the ramp to the chair seat. It's easier to lift the box using the ramp. 		1	2002-11-06 08:35:53	1	2003-02-20 16:10:02

   &quot;Go inside, Janet,&quot; he said.
   &quot;I can't.&quot; Janet said.
   &quot;Why not?&quot; Mr. Mack said. 'Would the school fall down if you didn't hold it up?&quot;
   &quot;Yes,&quot; Janet said.
   Mr. Mack got angry.
   &quot;MOVE!&quot; he said.

111	Brown	2a	2	2	   Coal is a black rock.  But it was made from green plants.
   A long time ago some big plants fell down.  In time other plants fell on top of them.  Water and sand covered the plants.  The water and sand pushed down on the plants.  The plants turned into coal.
   Now coal is burned to make light for some homes and schools.		1	2002-11-06 08:35:53	1	2002-11-13 10:15:52

125	Gold	2a	1	7	   Near the end of the 1908 Olympic marathon, Dorando Pietri, an Italian, put on a burst of speed and became the leader. It was the last of his energy, though. As he entered the stadium for the finish, he turned the wrong way on the inner track and collapsed. After someone revived him with water. Dorando got his bearings and ran towards the finish line, only to collapse again. The crowd groaned. After more than forty-two kilometers (twenty-six miles) of running, he had only a few meters to go. He was revived again, and again he fell. This happened three more times, and each time he came closer to the finish. Finally the officials couldn't stand it anymore, and they dragged him over the line. Just then John Hayes of the United States came onto the track and crossed the line right after Dorando.
   Sadly for the Italian, he was disqualified because he had been helped. Hayes won the gold medal.

126	Gold	2a	2	7	   Peccaries are small wild pigs. They live mostly in Central and South America. Even the largest peccaries are only about one meter (three feet) long and weigh thirty kilograms (sixty-six pounds).
   Peccaries travel in groups at night, searching for food. They are famous as snake hunters, and, like most other pigs, they aren't bothered by the poisonous venom of rattlesnakes. When peccaries meet a hungry bobcat or coyote, they use their speed or clever group defense to protect themselves. If a member of the group is wounded or chased, the whole herd may counterattack. And all predators have to watch out for their sharp tusks!
   Peccaries make more sounds than other pigs, Besides squeals and grunts, they have a barklike warning call; and they make an angry rattling noise by chattering their teeth together.
   Sleek and clean, peccaries &quot;wash&quot; themselves by pawing sand against their bellies with their forefeet. They also groom other peccaries in the herd.

127	Gold	2a	3	7	   Amelia Earhart, the famous pilot, disappeared many years ago. What, happened to her -- that mystery still remains. She and her navigator, Fred Noonan, were on a round-the-world flight. On July 2, 1937, they left New Guinea for an island in the South Pacific, and they were never seen again.
   Her disappearance caused an uproar. Amelia Earhart was one of the most famous women of her time. She was the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by air and the first woman to fly it alone. She also spoke frequently to groups of women about careers. She believed that every woman should have some way to earn a living and not be totally dependent on men -- an idea not always accepted.
   Many books have been written about Amelia Earhart's disappearance. Her plane had been low on fuel at the time, and perhaps it simply went down at sea. For years search parties looked for traces of the plane, but nothing was ever found.

128	Gold	2a	4	7	   The cow was a valuable possession in early America. In lean years when the crops failed and people had no money, they bartered the cow's butter and cheese for the goods they needed. Not everyone owned a cow, so butter was a luxury item.
   Children usually cared for the stock. It was their job to bring the milk pails to the house after milking and pour the warm milk into wooden tubs or trays. As the milk soured, cream was skimmed from the top and emptied into a tall wooden butter churn.
   When enough cream collected in the churn, a long round stick called a dasher was inserted and moved up and down until the cream bubbled and foamed and turned into a mass of floating lumps or curds.
   The churning continued, and the butter that finally resulted from this procedure was rinsed with cold water and salted. Then the newly made butter was shaped into squares, wrapped, and packed into tubs called firkins.

129	Gold	2a	5	7	   How is the world's growing population going to be fed in the future? Scientists have proposed a plan: undersea farms.
   Someday farmers may live for weeks underneath the seas. They may herd schools of fish with trained porpoises. They may harvest crops of seaweed.
   None of this is impossible to do even now. French and American scientists have already lived underwater for weeks at a time. A Japanese scientist has trained trout to obey commands; they return to a feeding station at a given signal. A porpoise has also been trained; it carried the mail to Americans living underwater. And seaweed is already an important crop to the Japanese people.
   There is one problem, however. The areas best suited to undersea farming are the shallow areas that push out beyond the shoreline. These are called the continental shelves. But they also receive most of the pollution discharged from the land into the sea. Unless controlled, pollution could greatly reduce their production.

130	Gold	2a	6	7	   On the Alaskan Island of Nunivak, winter winds howl across the tundra, whipping tails of ice and snow. The musk oxen that live there are ready for the cold.
   Their heavy hair is sometimes a foot long. Beneath it is a brown, woolly undercoat that is remarkably light and fluffy. The animals' hair hangs down around their legs like a blanket, holding in body heat and insulating them against the worst weather. Further features of their appropriate design are a short face, small ears, and almost no tail.
   The musk ox is dark in color, and males and females have the same coloration. The head is topped with horns that curve down the sides of the face and then turn out and upward.
   The adult male is about as tall as a nine-year-old child and weighs about three hundred forty kilograms (seven hundred fifty pounds). Females are smaller. Both feed on short, rugged plants, especially willows, and both are very protective of their young.

131	Gold	2a	7	7	   Our system of mathematics, weights, and measurements comes from the Sumerians and the Egyptians. Earlier peoples recorded the numbers they needed by cutting notches in a stick or tying knots in a cord. But later, priests needed large numbers and standard weights and measures for the business of the temple.  So did architects and surveyors laying out plots of farmland and building pyramids.
   Most early units of length were based on the human body. The cubit was the distance from the point of the elbow to the tip of the middle finger.
   Units of weight were all based on the weight of a grain of wheat. The shekel, the mina, and the talent were all multiples of this weight.
   The Sumerians also developed the duodecimal system of counting. It is based on twelves instead of the tens our decimal system uses. It is the ancestor of the twelves and sixties that remain in hours, minutes, ounces, and feet.

132	Gold	2a	8	7	   An ancient legend tells of a monster called the Sphinx. The Sphinx had the body of a lion and the head of a woman. The Sphinx lived on a rock outside the city of Thebes. It stopped all travelers and demanded the answer to this riddle -- &quot;What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?&quot;
   Anyone answering the riddle correctly was permitted to continue his journey, but no traveler passed on to Thebes, for no one could answer the riddle.
   Then a man named Oedipus came upon the monster and was asked the riddle.
   Oedipus replied, &quot;A person -- who crawls on all fours when a baby, walks on two legs when young, and walks with a cane when old.&quot;
   Oedipus was correct, and the Sphinx became so furious that it jumped off the rock, killing itself.
   Oedipus proceeded to Thebes, where the citizens were so grateful that they decided to make him their ruler.

133	Gold	2a	9	7	   Last year some nine hundred fifty thousand people toured the buildings of the worlds largest chocolate plant in Hershey, Pennsylvania. At the plant two dozen silos hold 90 million pounds of chocolate's raw material -- cacao beans. Milk from fifty thousand cows pours into the plant daily. Every day chocolate kisses pour out by the boxcar load, as do many other chocolate products.
   To make chocolate, the cacao beans are first roasted in large drums. Then fanlike machines crack the beans and blow away the husks.
   Huge disks crush the nibs, or meat, to make a bitter chocolate liquid. Some of this becomes baking chocolate. Some is fed to presses that squeeze out most of the butter, leaving cocoa powder.
   Milk, sugar, and cocoa butter are added to cocoa powder to make sweet chocolate. Rollers grind these into a thick paste. Then metal arms knead the paste into syrup. From there the chocolate is poured into molds, moved into cooling tunnels, and then wrapped.

134	Gold	2a	10	7	   The blue whale is the largest animal that has ever lived -- bigger than the biggest dinosaur. But even the blue whale isn't the largest living thing on earth. Trees are. And the largest of all trees are the redwoods and giant sequoias that grow in California.
   The tallest trees in the world are the California redwoods. Most of them grow to be more than ninety meters (three hundred feet) high -- about as tall as a thirty-story building. The tallest known redwood is almost 113 meters (370 feet) high!
   The giant sequoias are not as tall as the redwoods, but their trunks are much thicker. One big sequoia is called the General Sherman, after a famous soldier. The tree is 83 meters (272 feet) high. The widest part of its trunk is more than 30 meters (100 feet) around and more than 11 meters (36 feet) across. A big crowd of people could hide behind this tree!

135	Gold	2a	11	7	   This is a true story about the famous composer Wolfgang Mozart, whose family called him Wolferl.
   When Wolferl was four years old, his father found him one day on the living-room floor with paper, pen, and ink, completely absorbed in his work. &quot;What are you doing, Wolferl?&quot; he inquired.
   &quot;I am writing a piece for the piano,&quot; his son answered. &quot;The first part is almost done.&quot;
   Wolferl's father laughed when he picked up the messy, ink-smeared paper that was covered with notes and stains. But when he took a closer look at the composition, he became very serious.
   &quot;It's a fine concerto, Wolferl, very well composed,&quot; he said as he handed it back. &quot;Only it's so difficult that nobody will be able to play it.&quot;
   &quot;But it is a concerto, papa, and has to be difficult,&quot; Wolfed answered seriously. &quot;You must practice it until you can do it. Look -- like this,&quot; and he sat down at the piano and played parts of his composition.

136	Gold	2a	12	7	From the age of ten, when she worked on her parents' farm, Ruth Asawa dreamed of becoming an artist. &quot;Be practical,&quot; some adults advised. &quot;You cannot make a living as an artist. Be a teacher.&quot; But Asawa's parents, who once had to work eighteen hours a day, encouraged her. &quot;Art,&quot; they said, &quot;couldn't be less secure than farming.&quot; 
   During World War II Asawa, like other Japanese in the United States, was confined in a camp. Japanese artists who worked for Walt Disney instructed her in art there. Later she attended school in North Carolina, where painter Josef Albers and others inspired her.
   Asawa now lives in San Francisco, where she has become famous for the fountains she creates. She likes to make objects out of bread dough. These are later turned into bronze castings. She also likes to involve other people in her work. At least two hundred and fifty people created objects that were used in one of her fountains.

137	Gold	2a	13	7	   Many people believe that the custom of wearing trousers began about the time the Italian city of Venice was founded. The cause was Attila the barbarian.
   About the year AD. 450 Attila, the leader of the Huns, invaded the Roman Empire. These cruel horsemen burned cities and killed or made slaves of many people.
   To escape Attila, some Italians took boats and settled on sandbars off the coast. They built a settlement on the water that became the city of Venice.
   But as the people fled, they noticed the strange clothes Attila and his men wore. They did not wear the long robes that most people wore. The Huns spent long hours on their horses, and so to protect their legs from the constant rubbing they enclosed them in skins and furs sewed together.  These &quot;trousers&quot; seemed comfortable and convenient. So other people all over Europe began wearing trousers too.
   That is why we can thank Attila for
Venice and for trousers.

138	Gold	2a	14	7	   The game of soccer is the most popular spectator sport in the world. In 1966, 700 million people saw the World Cup games televised. In 1970 even more fans watched the games -- more than 300 million saw the last game alone. In 1974 the number of viewers of the final game reached almost 500 million.
   Soccer is played in more countries than is basketball, baseball, American and Canadian football, or ice hockey. In Europe and South America the game is almost a way of life. Hundreds of thousands of fans jam local stadiums for weekly games.
   Soccer was brought into the United States in the 1880s. But wide acceptance of the game has been slow. And that is hard to understand. Soccer boasts all the thrills of ice hockey, the spectacle of American and Canadian football, and the emotion of Olympic contests. The game is growing in popularity however. An estimated one million people now play soccer in the United States.

139	Gold	2a	15	7	   The Portuguese man-of-war, a relative of the jellyfish, floats on the warm seas of the world. Human swimmers keep away from that creature's dangling tentacles because their poisonous sting is quite painful. For most fish, though, the sting is deadly: that's how the man-of-war catches its dinner.
   One small fish, <i>Nomeus</i>, actually makes its home in those tentacles. For some unknown reason, it isn't bothered by the poison.
   The man-of-war helps <i>Nomeus</i> by providing it a safe place to hide from its enemies. In return, <i>Nomeus</i> helps the man-of-war get its dinner. As <i>Nomeus</i> darts about in the ocean, its bright markings attract other fish. Then it swims toward the man-of-war. The other fish follow and are quickly stung to death. Soon the man-of-war is eating its prey. Small bits and pieces float away in the water, and <i>Nomeus</i> gobbles them up. In this way, the little fish and its protector help each other get a meal.

154	Orange	2a	1	6	There's a fish that has scientists baffled. This fish breathes through it's nose, sees through its skin, and ties it's self into a knot.  It lives off an east Siberian peninsula and is called the hagfish.  The hagfish can go without food for more than a year. When it's scared, it hides inside a blob of jelly that it squirts into the water around it.  The hagfish has four hearts. Each heart beats in a different rhythm and they separately control the fish's head, tail. muscles, and liver. Sensitive cells all over the hagfish's body enable it to &quot;see&quot; where it is going. It's spine bends so easily that this fish can tie itself into a knot. Unlike other fish, it breathes through its nose, rather than through gills. Is it any wonder that the hagfish has fish scientists scratching their heads? 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:02	1	2003-02-25 15:22:47
155	Orange	2a	2	6	   In 1880 in Norway a couple of farm lads uncovered a Viking ship buried in a trench of blue clay. Its timbers had not rotted in over a thousand years because the clay had kept air away. 
   The ship was about twenty-three meters (seventy-six feet) long and five meters (seventeen feet) wide, and it weighed some twenty tons. Yet it could have sailed in water only a meter deep. It had a mast that could be taken apart; its large square sail probably had been made of wool. 
   There were openings for sixteen pairs of oars. In rough weather these could be brought on board and the openings covered with movable flaps. The ship would have carried about thirty-five Vikings, and it was steered by a large oar attached to the outside of the ship near the stern. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:02	1	2003-02-06 16:54:44
156	Orange	2a	3	6	A meteor is a piece of frozen gas that may have gone round the sun for as long as a billion years. When a meteor hits the earth's air it slows to about 50 kilometers (30 miles) a second. It usually burns up at from 60 to 100 kilometers (40 to 60 miles) above the earth. 
   It is often called a shooting star. This is because it leaves a burning cloud of gas behind it. A fireball is a meteor that is so bright that it makes shadows on the ground. 
   But not all meteors burn up. Some do reach the ground. When one does it is called a meteorite. Meteorites are very heavy for their size. They have many minerals in them. Because they hold a lot of iron, they sometimes rust away before they are found. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:02	1	2005-12-22 15:05:38
157	Orange	2a	4	6	The Christmas tree has many ancestors. Ancient Egyptians took the green date palm, a symbol of long life, into their homes. Romans trimmed trees with toys and masks of the god Bacchus. In northern Europe the Druids brought gifts of apples, cakes, and fish tied to branches for their god Woden. The Christmas tree custom started in Germany. Who began it is not certain, however. Some give credit to Martin Luther. The story goes that Luther wanted to share with his children the Joy he had felt on an earlier, starlit Christmas Eve. Lacking the right words to describe the beautiful scene, he cut a fir and placed lighted candles on its branches. From Germany the custom spread to Finland, Sweden, and Norway, all countries of forests. It wasn't until the 1830s and 1840s that Christmas trees appeared in England and America.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:02	1	2003-02-11 17:05:06
158	Orange	2a	5	6	   One of the problems large land animals in Africa have is the great number of small insects that live in their; hide. Buffalo, antelopes, and rhinoceroses are constantly bothered by these tiny creatures, but nature does provide a way of dealing with this problem. The solution is in the form of oxpeckers. These are birds that feed on the ticks and flies found on the big animals. 
   The animals welcome the birds. They are pleased to be rid of the insects, and, of course, the birds are happy, for their meals are assured. The animals profit in a second way, too. Oxpeckers are quick to pick up most signs of looming danger. The birds will warn their host at once. If the animal fails to respond, the little birds will peck urgently at its head until it gets the message.   		1	2002-11-06 08:36:03	1	2003-02-06 15:34:11
159	Orange	2a	6	6	Dolphins often appear in Greek and Roman myths. The Greek god Apollo chose to become a dolphin when he was on his way to build his temple at Delphi. Neptune, the Roman god of the sea, sent a dolphin to capture a bride. Venus, the Roman goddess of beauty, often had a dolphin as an escort. Odysseus, the famous Greek warrior, chose the dolphin as the sign on his shield. One of the oldest myths tells how a Greek poet and musician, Anon, was saved by a music-loving dolphin. Some sailors robbed Anon: they were about to throw him into the sea. He asked them to let him sing before he died. Attracted by the tune, a dolphin swam to the ship. When Anon was thrown overboard, the dolphin took him on its back and carried him to shore.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:03	1	2003-02-11 17:41:35
160	Orange	2a	7	6	When Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring in 1955, she was called &quot;silly.&quot; The book warned against spraying pest killers such as DDT on plants and crops. While pest killers made it possible to grow more food, they killed birds, fish. and other animals. They also settled in the soil and were taken in by plants and animals. These might be eaten by humans, and the pest killers might cause cancer in humans. The makers of pest killers fought back angrily, but people began to listen to Carson. She had become interested in science in college. She loved the sea. She wrote her first two books about it: Under the Sea Wind and The Sea around Us. Silent Spring finally moved many to stop using DDT and to curb pollution. They now realized that we are part of nature and not its masters.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:03	1	2003-02-11 18:03:54
161	Orange	2a	8	6	Rocks are so familiar that you may never have given them a thought, but they have been around for millions of years-much, much longer than people. Early men and women used rock caves for shelter. They used rocks as weapons-to catch their food or fight their enemies. They struck stones together to make sparks to start a fire for cooking and warmth. Before paper was invented, people wrote on flat stones. In times of war, stones were scattered over the enemy's fields so that farmers could not grow crops, and the enemy would not have food. Villages used to have a miller who ground the farmers' grain, taking part of the flour as payment for his work. The miller's most prized possession was his millstone. Without a good stone, he would have been unable to grind the grain into flour.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:03	1	2003-02-13 10:37:20
162	Orange	2a	10	6	Do you know how some oceans and seas got their names? The Pacific Ocean was named by the Spanish explorer Magellan. When Magellan sailed on the ocean, it was peaceful. In Spanish, the word for peaceful is pacifico. The Atlantic Ocean got its name from the ancient Romans. In those days people thought that the Atlas Mountains in Africa were the end of the world. Since the ocean was on the other side of these mountains, they named it the Atlantic. The Dead Sea, in Israel and Jordan, was named by travelers many years ago. They never saw any birds fly over the sea. So they thought the air above the sea was poisonous. The Black Sea, between Europe and Asia, got its name from the fact that, in winter, heavy fog makes the water look dark and murky.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:03	1	2003-02-25 16:31:25
163	Orange	2a	11	6	   A tornado is a whirling, rushing wind that roars over the ground like a giant vacuum cleaner. It pulls up dust and dirt, uproots trees, explodes houses outwards, and hurls automobiles into the air.
 A tornado starts when a thick layer of cold, dry air flows over a thick layer of warm, humid air. Some of the cold air pushes down into the layer of warm air, and some of the warm air rises very quickly into the layer of cold air. As the warm air rises, other warm air rushes in to take its place. This makes the air start to spin. The more it rushes the faster it spins, until it is a heavy black cloud of whirling, rushing air and dust.
 A tornado over the ocean is called a waterspout. It is a funnel of both water and air.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:04	1	2003-02-20 16:43:47
164	Orange	2a	12	6	   Until recently it was a mystery how certain large bees were able to fly. A bee's body seemed too heavy and its wings seemed too small for it to stay up in the air. The mystery was so intriguing that a few scientists decided to study the bee.
 Most insects fly by flapping their wings with great speed. For example, the locust beats its wings at a rate of about twenty times a second. Other flying insects have to beat their wings even faster-perhaps as rapidly as one hundred times a second.
 But bees must work extra hard to fly, scientists discovered. Honeybees beat their wings about two hundred times a second. And bumblebees are even heavier, wider, and longer than honeybees. Scientists found that bumblebees have to beat their wings at the amazing rate of three hundred times a second or more. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:05	1	2004-07-22 17:15:19
165	Orange	2a	13	6	   Although she's fifty years old, she's the most popular ever created. She's Raggedy Ann, and her orange-red hair, rosy cheeks, and silly grin have captured the hearts of generations. One toy company sold 6.5 million of the dolls in the past ten. years.
 How did Raggedy Ann come to be? She was created by Johnny Gruelle. Worth Gruelle, Johnny's son, recalls that his sister found an old doll in the attic. Johnny repaired it for her.
 The doll became Johnny's inspiration for stories about a doll that magically came to life when her little mistress went to sleep. The name, the son remembers, came from two poems by James Whitcomb Riley: &quot;The Raggedy Man&quot; and &quot;Little Orphan Annie.&quot;
 Worth Gruelle said of his father's stories, &quot;He didn't like violence. . . . Everything always turned out right in the end.&quot;  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:05	1	2003-02-25 16:32:02
166	Orange	2a	14	6	   There are different lands of cowboys in the world. Cowboys of Kazakhstan, in Russia, don't ride horses. They ride camels! And on long cattle drives they are sometimes directed by radio from planes. 
 Australian cowboys are stockmen or jackaroos. A roundup is a muster and wild horses are brumbies. A ranch is called a cattle station. A cattle station in Australia is the largest ranch in the world. It's twice as big as the state of Massachusetts.
 In Argentina cowboys are called gauchos. In roping, the gaucho equals any cowboy in the world. But he is even better with his bola. This is a short rope with two or three ends to which leather-covered stone balls are fastened. The gaucho throws it with deadly aim. It curls tightly round the ankles of a man or animal-even round the long legs of the wild birds, the rheas.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:05	1	2003-02-25 16:33:14
167	Orange	2a	15	6	   Scientists are busy searching Loch Ness, a lake in Scotland, for the so-called Loch Ness water monster. So far, they haven't found the monster. But they have found a group of stone buildings in the lake. The scientists think that these structures were built by people three or four thousand years ago.
 Why are the buildings underwater? Scientists say these structures were first built on dry land. But, over the years, the water level of Loch Ness has risen about ten meters (thirty feet) and covered the buildings.
 A stone wall, the ruins of a fort, and several large piles of stones-called cairns- were found in Loch Ness. The cairns were probably used in religious ceremonies.
 At one time there were many cairns in Scotland. Most of them have been destroyed. Scientists hope to learn more about ancient people from studying these underwater claims.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:06	1	2003-02-20 16:58:42
168	Purple	2a	6	4	You just blinked. Your eyelids just went down and up. A blink lasts for less than half a second. Your eyes actually close, but it happens so fast that you don't really miss anything. Blinks come every two to ten seconds. This is the way your eyelids clean away dust from your eyes. Your eyelashes help keep dust and dirt out of your eyes too. But eyelashes are always falling out. They last only three to five months. Luckily, you do have 400 of them. So if one falls out the next time you blink, don't worry. You still have 399 more. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:06	1	2003-02-25 16:34:45

171	Purple	2a	9	4	You can see your breath when you breathe out into cold air. But you can't see your breath on a hot day. Why not? The warm, moist air that you breathe out is called vapor. In summer your warm, moist breath mixes with the warm, moist air round you. You can't see the difference between your breath and the air. But it's different on a cold day. Some vapor changes to water when it becomes cold. So the cold air changes your warm, moist breath into a stream of tiny droplets of water. The stream appears as a thin, white mist. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:06	1	2003-02-12 11:38:17
172	Purple	2a	10	4	Today when we need clothes most of us buy them. But one hundred fifty years ago clothes weren't bought at shops. A tailor or seamstress made them. Or clothes were made at home by hand. There were no sewing machines. Cloth for clothes cost a lot of money.
   So some children's clothes were made from clothes that had become too small for older brothers and sisters. When people wanted new cloth, they often had to wait until a cloth seller came to their house. But that didn't happen often; maybe only once a year. So clothes had to last a long time. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:06	1	2003-02-25 16:36:28

 Put lemon juice into a small dish. Dip a toothpick into the juice and write a message. You can use any kind of white paper. The toothpick won't hold much ink. You must dip it after every word. 
 When your friend gets the message, it will look like a blank piece of paper. But when he or she puts the paper close to heat - a hot iron or a light bulb - the writing will appear. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:07	1	2003-02-25 16:38:44
174	Purple	2a	12	4	   A bee's stinger is barbed like a fish-hook, so that once it goes in, it is very hard to pull out. When it stings, the bee dies because a hole is left in its body when its stinger is torn off.
 A wasp has a stinger like a needle, which does not tear off. So a wasp can sting many times.
 Remember, when a bee or wasp is buzzing near you, don't show fear and wave your hands. Just keep calm, and it will mind its own business, if you make it angry, then it may try to sting you. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:07	1	2006-12-09 14:28:22

176	Purple	2a	14	4	   How can a metal spoon in a drinking glass keep it from cracking? A glass may crack if hot water is poured into it too quickly. But if a glass warms up slowly, it won't crack. That's just what a metal spoon is used for. It keeps heat from reaching the glass quickly.
 Heat travels quickly through most metals. When you put a metal spoon into a glass and then pour in a hot drink, heat rushes into the spoon and flows up through it. Much less heat flows to the glass. The glass warms up slowly and it doesn't crack. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:07	1	2003-02-20 17:06:07
177	Purple	2a	15	4	   People have always wanted to fly. They saw birds soaring above the earth and dreamed of flying. A Greek legend tells of two people who realized this dream.
 Icarus and his father had angered a king. They were made prisoners on the island of Crete. To escape, they made wings of feathers. They fastened the wings to their shoulders and arms with wax. Then they jumped from a cliff and flapped their arms. And they flew away over the sea.
 But Icarus flew too high. The hot sun melted the wax on his wings. And Icarus fell into the sea. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:07	1	2003-02-20 17:08:00
178	Red	2a	1	5.5	The little prince in Saint-Exupery's book <i>The Little Prince</i> came from a small asteroid. In fact, his world was scarcely larger than a house. It had three volcanoes on it -two active ones that were very handy for heating breakfast, and one that seemed to be extinct. They were, of course, tiny volcanoes. &quot;Where I live.&quot; said the little prince, &quot;everything is so small.&quot;
    There was grass on the asteroid. And there were tiny daisylike flowers. There were also baobab trees that had to be dug up as soon as they began to sprout. Otherwise, they might grow so enormous that their roots would split the planet. But there was one plant the little prince watered and cared for. It was a beautiful rose, the only rose on Asteroid B612.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:07	1	2003-02-25 16:44:31
179	Red	2a	2	5.5	When the sun shines, a leaf becomes a food factory. Sunlight comes into a leaf through the leaf's skin, which is clear like glass. Beneath the skin are millions of tiny &quot;bags&quot; called cells. Inside the cells are small packages filled with a green stuff called chlorophyll. The chlorophyll catches sunlight. Air comes into the leaf through many tiny openings. Water and minerals, moving up from the roots far below, flow through the leaf. The air and water mix together and flow into the cells. Green chlorophyll, using sunlight for energy, changes water and a gas from the air (called carbon dioxide) into sugar. Some of this sugar is used by the plant as food. Some is mixed with minerals from the ground and changed into other kinds of food.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:08	1	2003-02-12 12:28:13
180	Red	2a	3	5.5	Valentines in the 1800s were quite fancy. Many cards were made from paper lace.  Pictures of birds, flowers, and hearts were painted on them by hand. Some were even made from real silk or lace. Special valentines might contain a tiny mirror or puzzle or locks of hair. There were cards printed to look like real money from the Bank of Love. One of them looked so real that it was quickly called back. The famous English artist Kate Greenaway designed valentines. She sold her first design for eight pounds (fifteen dollars). Today her cards, which often show children, are very valuable. Esther Rowland was one of the first people in the United States to manufacture valentines. She had a group of women making the cards. Sales were soon $100,000 a year. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:08	1	2004-11-13 10:48:01
181	Red	2a	4	5.5	Nat Love had long dreamed of becoming a cowboy. The former slave, already an excellent rider, had a job breaking horses in Tennessee. One day he won a horse in a raffle. He sold it, gave his mother half the money, and went west. Nat became a legend as a champion rider, roper, and sharpshooter. Once in Deadwood, South Dakota, he did so well in shooting, riding, and roping contests and was so well liked that people there nicknamed him Deadwood Dick. Another time Nat was captured by Indians. Because he was so brave, they didn't kill him. The chief wanted Nat to become a member of the tribe. But Nat wanted to stay a cowboy. One night he escaped by jumping on a fast horse and riding out of camp. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:08	1	2006-06-07 15:26:58
182	Red	2a	5	5.5	The greater rhea is a big gray bird of Brazil and Argentina that cannot fly but can run as fast as a horse. The father cares for his young without any help. For five weeks he sits on the eggs laid by the female and hisses loudly at any animal that comes too close, including the mother rhea. When the chicks hatch, they follow their father as he pecks at insects and leaves. He keeps a close watch on his big family. At night and when it rains, the father kneels on the ground and gathers his chicks beneath his wings. Some crawl up his back and nestle snugly in his feathers. Their father watches over them like this for three or four months until they are big enough to defend themselves. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:08	1	2003-02-25 16:45:35
183	Red	2a	6	5.5	The ancestor of the bicycle was built in France about 1700. It was called the walk-along. It looked like two wagon wheels held together by a hardwood bar. The bike couldn't be steered, and it had no pedals. The rider straddled the bike and walked or ran, occasionally lifting the feet to coast. In 1816 an inventor developed a vehicle that could be steered. Before then a rider had to get off the bike, pick it up, and turn it around to change direction. About 1840, pedals were put on the front wheel. Builders then began enlarging the front wheel so that the bike would travel a long distance on each turn of the pedal. Meanwhile the back wheel was being made smaller and smaller. These bikes were called high-wheelers or penny-farthings. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:08	1	2003-10-04 09:10:23
184	Red	2a	8	5.5	The game of badminton was originally seen in India, where it was known as &quot;poona.&quot; It was popular with English army officers based there. In 1870 these officers brought the game back to England with them. They introduced it to their friends, and the game was soon played at most English resorts. It became known as &quot;badminton,&quot; named after the Duke of Beaufoil's home where his guests often played the new game. Badminton is one of the fastest of court games. It is like lawn tennis in many ways. It is played by two or four players, in or out of doors. A cone-shaped object, the shuttlecock, is hit back and forth until a player fails to return it. The game calls for speed, alertness, and more skill than most court games. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:09	1	2007-02-23 15:05:47
185	Red	2a	9	5.5	Bricks are made of mud. But they don't squash when you pile them up to construct a building, and they don't crumble when you walk on them. Bricks are so sturdy because they're made of a special kind of earth, called clay, that is baked in an oven. Brickmakers grind the clay and blend it with water until it is a muddy mass. A brickmaking machine pushes the muddy mass through a hole. And when the mass comes out of the hole, it looks like a thick ribbon of clay. Another machine, called a brick cutter. slices the clay ribbon into rectangular blocks. Then the brickmakers shove the bricks into big ovens, called kilns, where they are baked hard enough not to squash or crumble.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:09	1	2006-11-14 07:25:53
186	Red	2a	10	5.5	One of the strangest sights in the world is a river running backwards. One river that does this is the Petitcodiac in New Brunswick, Canada. Several times a year crowds gather on the river's bank to see this. And someone usually calls out, &quot;Here it comes.&quot; Then, coming up the river is a wall of water. This wall is called a bore. The bore can be a meter high (about three feet), and it's one of the biggest bores in the world. It races up the river and for a while the river runs backwards. Why does this happen? The river flows into the Bay of Fundy and sometimes the tides in the bay are so strong that they push a wall of water up the river and the river's current is reversed.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:09	1	2003-02-12 15:13:50
187	Red	2a	11	5.5	   Think Mink! That's what many Hawaiians were saying in 1964. The reason? Patsy Mink was seeking election to the United States House of Representatives.
 Mink won. She celebrated by painting in the missing eye on a daruma, a doll. The eyes, by Japanese custom, are put in only when a wish comes true. &quot;I painted one eye in after the primary,&quot; Mink recalls, &quot;the other, when I was elected.&quot;
 Mink is concerned about women's rights. She felt that girls in school didn't know they had a choice of many careers. She wrote a bill that would make money available so teachers can learn better ways of informing girls of these choices. The bill also would set up places to help women whose children are grown and who want to return to work. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:09	1	2007-04-07 10:32:04
188	Red	2a	12	5.5	   Think of camels and you think of Arabia-right? But here's a strange fact: Camels didn't appear first in Arabia: they came from America! 
 Fossil remains tell us they appeared in North America 40 million years ago. Then they spread to Asia and died out in their homeland.
 But in the 1850s, the U.S. Army brought camels back. It tried them out as pack animals in the deserts of the southwest United States. The attempt failed, though, and the camels were released to run wild. last wild camel died around 1900.
 Sadly, camels are now dying out in Arabia. To many young Arabs, camels are old-fashioned and smelly. They dislike being bounced around on a camel's hump. They prefer instead the comfort of a car.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:09	1	2003-02-20 17:12:34
189	Red	2a	13	5.5	   Pedro Alonso Nino, a black, was with Columbus when he discovered the New World. Nino guided the ship Nina across the ocean; Columbus sailed on the Santa Maria. There was little food and drinking water. Many of the sailors wanted to turn back for home. They were afraid. But Nino believed in Columbus.
 One morning they saw land birds flying over their ships and branches and flowers floating in the water. They knew that this meant land was near. On Friday, October 12, 1492, they saw land.
 Nino went ashore with Columbus. Nino and the others stayed in the New World for several -weeks. During their stay the Santa Maria was destroyed by a storm. So it was Nino's ship, the Nina, that carried Columbus back to Spain. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:10	1	2003-02-25 16:47:51
190	Red	2a	14	5.5	   The dandelion is a plant that grows throughout the world. However, there were no dandelions in North America before Europeans settled there. Early settlers brought the plant with them to use for food and medicine. The dandelion was a rich source of vitamins and minerals for the settlers. They used the whole plant. 
 In the spring, the settlers boiled the leaves to make a green tonic. They used the tonic for medicine. They also used the young, tender dandelion leaves as a vegetable, either raw in salads, or boiled like spinach. They dried some leaves and used them to make tea. The tea might be used as medicine. The settlers made wine or jam from the dandelion blossoms. They roasted and ground the roots to make a coffeelike drink.   		1	2002-11-06 08:36:10	1	2003-02-20 17:17:01
191	Red	2a	15	5.5	   Shane Gould began swimming because as a child in the Fiji Islands she spilled boiling tea over herself. Doctors believed swimming would help heal her skin. She also enjoyed climbing tall palm trees. This developed muscles used in swimming.
 At the age of nine Shane began swimming in Australia to win medals. Her coach, Forbes Carlile, believed she could be a champion. She swam five or seven kilometers (three or four miles) every day. When she was fourteen, she set her first world's record swimming the 400-meter freestyle. In 1972, she swam the 100-meter freestyle in a record 58.5 seconds. She won five medals in the 1972 Olympics.
 Afterwards people expected her always to break a record. Shane became tired of swimming in races. She abandoned it to start a new life.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:10	1	2003-02-20 17:18:55
192	Rose	2a	6	5	Animals have many kinds of feet, and their feet may give you clues about where they live and how they move. Some animals are flat-footed. Animals such as bears and gorillas have flat feet and spend most of their time walking on the ground. Cats, dogs, wolves, foxes, and some other animals walk on their toes, just as you do when you walk on tiptoe. This kind of walking is good for silent stalking and for fast running. Cat feet and dog feet both have claws, but those of a cat are sharp, retractile (able to be pulled back in), and good for grabbing prey. Dog claws are dull, can't be pulled back in, and are good for digging and scratching. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:10	1	2003-02-12 15:28:27
193	Rose	2a	8	5	In early America, Indian squaws did all the work of the tribe except hunting. They cooked, sewed, raised crops, and built houses. They dragged back dead beasts from the hunt. When the tribe was on the move, they carried great loads. &quot;Their women are their mules!&quot; said an early French explorer. But Indians thought more of their squaws than they seemed to. They told whites to take Indian women with them on their trips. If they did not, the whites were warned, they might not survive. The whites soon found that this was true. Indian women served as their guides. The best-known was Sacajawea, who helped Lewis and Clark. But two others went with Alexander Mackenzie to the Arctic Ocean. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:10	1	2003-04-28 09:48:15
194	Rose	2a	10	5	Sunflowers are big plants with thick, hairy stems and big heart-shaped leaves. They can grow to be four meters (thirteen feet) tall. The flowers can be as big as dinner plates. Sunflower seeds were a useful food for many Native American tribes. The Indians dried the seeds and ground them into powder. They then used this powder to make bread and to thicken soup. Sometimes they mixed the powdered seeds with fat and made a sort of pudding. The flowers grow wild in prairies and meadows. Yet there are sunflower farms in many parts of the world. Oil from the seeds is used to make margarine, cooking oils, paint, and soap. And many people like to eat the seeds. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:11	1	2003-02-12 15:42:15

 She went to the Olympic track and field tryouts in 1932. She entered eight events. She won six of them and took one second and one third place. In the Olympics she was allowed to enter three events. She took firsts in the 80-meter hurdles and the javelin. In the running high jump, she jumped as high as the winner.

196	Rose	2a	13	5	   Eskimos call their homes igloos. A summer igloo may be a canvas or deerskin tent; a year-round igloo may be a wood, stone, or sod house; and a winter igloo may be a snow hut. 
 Eskimos build a snow igloo by cutting hard-packed snow into thick blocks, shaping and fitting them together, and then patching cracks with snow. Inside the igloo, Eskimos make a raised place out of snow and cover it with furs. Then the family has a warm place to sleep and eat.
 Eskimos light and heat the igloo with an oil lamp and cut a small hole in the roof to let the stale air out. The freezing cold outside keeps the igloo from melting.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:11	1	2007-04-19 17:16:28
197	Rose	2a	14	5	   A worm is a special sort of creature. It does not have a backbone as snakes do. It does not have legs as lizards do. And though it has something like feet, it is not a caterpillar.
 One important worm is the earthworm. Earthworms are a powerful force in the world. As they eat their way through the soil, worms break down dead plant matter. This helps make soil fertile. And the tunnels that worms leave behind allow air to move through the soil.
 Worms live everywhere in the world except in the polar and high mountain areas. There may be as many as three million worms in one hectare (2.5 acres) of land. And these busy creatures are doing a lot of good.   		1	2002-11-06 08:36:11	1	2003-02-20 17:24:07
198	Rose	2a	15	5	   Roberto Clemente was born to play baseball. In eighteen years with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Clemente dazzled fans with excellent fielding and hitting. Clemente would leap to catch a ball and throw it before his feet hit the ground. He would crash into walls to make catches. His career batting average was .317, with three thousand hits. He played on twelve All-Star teams.
 But he was more than a great player. Clemente came from Puerto Rico. He worked to build a sports city for children there. In 1972 he learned of an earthquake in Nicaragua. He collected supplies, medicine, and money. Flying to aid the people there, he died in a plane crash.

199	Violet	2a	6	4.5	The Shetland Islands are in the Atlantic Ocean near the North Sea. These islands have rugged coasts and high cliffs. There are more than a hundred islands in the group. People live on fewer than twenty of them. Norsemen once sailed to these islands.
    Traces of the Norse can still be noticed in the speech and ways of the people. The Shetland Islands are well known for their knitted and woven goods. The wool for these comes from their long- haired Shetland sheep. A kind of small cattle once lived on the islands.

There are more than four times as many kinds of insects as there are kinds of all other animals together. Flies, bees, ants, and fleas are insects. So are mosquitoes. So are butterflies and moths. Insects may look different, but they all are alike in these ways. They have six legs. Their bodies have three parts: head; thorax, or middle; abdomen, or rear. They have a hard outer covering that is their skeleton. They have green, yellow, or clear blood. They are hatched from eggs. And most adult insects have wings. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:12	1	2003-02-12 15:49:28
201	Violet	2a	8	4.5	The sun shines because it is made of glowing gases. It gives off its own light. The moon shines too. But it doesn't give off any light of its own. We can see the moon only because it reflects (bounces back) light from the sun. The moon travels around the earth about every twenty-nine days. During this time, the moon looks as if it changes size and shape. It seems to grow from a small part of a shining circle into a full circle, then it becomes small again. The moon doesn't really change. It just seems to because we see different parts of it lit up by the sun.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:12	1	2004-02-13 16:26:02
202	Violet	2a	9	4.5	The maple tree is a special tree in Canada. The national flag has a red maple leaf. Some coins are printed with pictures of maple leaves. There is even a hockey team named after the tree-the Toronto Maple Leafs. But one of the best things about the tree is maple syrup. It is made from sap, a thin liquid in the tree. The sap is taken from trees in early spring, and syrup is made. Then people meet for &quot;sugaring off&quot; parties. Hot syrup is poured on clean snow. The syrup hardens into a waxy toffee. It is scooped up with forks and eagerly eaten. People also eat maple sugar. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:12	1	2003-02-12 16:03:33
203	Violet	2a	10	4.5	If you see a tree with acorns on it, you can be certain it is an oak tree.  There are many different kinds of oak. Each land has differently shaped leaves and acorns, but most oaks are divided into two main groups-the white group and the red group. The leaves of the white group are smooth and rounded, and the leaves of the red group have sharp points on the tips. Acorns are nuts, the seeds of the oak trees. They sit in cups with two or three acorns together near the ends of the branches. Acorns need to be buried in the ground before they can grow into oak trees.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:12	1	2004-11-20 13:14:59
204	Violet	2a	11	4.5	   A thirsty ant went to the bank of a river to get a drink and was carried away by the strong current. A dove that was perched in a nearby tree saw what was happening. She dropped a leaf in the water. The ant climbed on it and floated to the bank.
 Shortly afterwards a bird catcher crept up to the tree. He laid a trap for the dove, who was still sitting in the branches. The ant saw the man's plan and bit him on the foot. His cry of pain warned the dove of the danger, and she flew off.
 Thankfulness will always find a way of showing itself. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:13	1	2003-02-20 17:27:08
205	Violet	2a	12	4.5	   Have you ever seen belts or purses made out of knots? This art is called macrame. It is often used to make things to wear. But wall hangings are often made this way too.
 Macrame objects may be made from cord, rope, or string. Many cords are knotted together. The knots most often used are the clove hitch and the square knot. Beads, bells, feathers, or other small objects may be tied into the work.
 People think that weavers in the Near East began this art in the 1200s. We know that sailors in the 1800s knotted such things as bottle covers and nets. Today many people make things with macrame.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:13	1	2003-02-20 17:28:48
206	Violet	2a	13	4.5	   George Washington Carver wasn't born a free man. He was born a slave in the United States about 1860. 
 Carver went to school and became a botanist, someone who studies plants. He wanted to help farmers in the southern states find new crops to raise. Most farmers grew only cotton. If the cotton crop failed, they made no money. Carver told them about peanuts and sweet potatoes. These crops grew well in the south.
 Carver also found new ways to use the crops. He made instant coffee, soap, paper, ink, and over three hundred other things from peanuts. And he made flour, candy, and over one hundred other things from sweet potatoes.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:13	1	2004-12-04 11:59:57
207	Violet	2a	14	4.5	   Nearly every word has a story behind it. The word breakfast, for example, is made up of two smaller words, break and fast. When someone fasts, it means he or she doesn't eat. Most people fast from bedtime until they rise in the morning. They break their fast when they eat breakfast. 
 Spoonerism is an odd word. It comes from the name of the Reverend W. A. Spooner. who often got his words mixed up. If he wanted to say. &quot;May I show you to your seat?&quot; he might say instead, &quot;May I sew you to your sheet?&quot; When people mix up their speech in this way, they have made a spoonerism.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:13	1	2003-02-25 16:52:51

 The first thing they discovered was that the moon was covered with gray dust so thick that they left footprints wherever they walked. Those were the first footprints ever made on the moon. And the footprints could stay there forever. There is no wind or rain to wipe them away.
 The two astronauts walked on the moon for four hours. They picked up rocks for earth scientists to study. They set up machines to find out things scientists wanted to know. Then they began the long trip back to earth.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:13	1	2003-02-25 16:56:37
209	Aqua	2c	1	7	According to Greek legend, a terrible monster called the Sphinx once dwelt atop a rock on the road to Thebes. She stopped all travelers and demanded an answer to the riddle &quot;'What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?&quot; Travelers who answered correctly were to be allowed to pass-but no traveler passed on to Thebes, for none could answer her riddle. Then a man named Oedipus, appearing on the road, was stopped by the monster and asked to answer the riddle. Oedipus replied, &quot;Man-who crawls on all fours in the morning of his life, walks on two legs in the middle of his life, and walks with a cane in the evening of his life.&quot; Hearing the correct answer so overwhelmed the monster that she committed suicide by leaping from her rock. Oedipus continued on to Thebes, where the people, grateful to him for ridding them of the Sphinx, made him their ruler.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:13	1	2003-02-12 17:25:51
210	Aqua	2c	2	7	The tuatara is the last descendant of the dinosaur. It crawls along in New Zealand, protected by a strict law against killing it. Only two feet long, the tuatara looks like a miniature of the huge dinosaurs that inhabited the earth millions of years ago. It has a row of spines on its back that look very dangerous, but are really soft and flexible. The tuatara's body is a yellowish green and has a large head and short legs. A third eye, covered by skin, is this reptile's strangest feature. The third eye is said to be the remains of a second pair of eyes. The tuatara lives on grasshoppers, flies, and spiders. It has very sharp teeth and bites viciously when it fights with another tuatara. Its only sound is an occasional croak. Some tuataras have been in captivity for fifty years. It is said that some of these reptiles might live for hundreds of years. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:14	1	2003-02-12 17:36:39
211	Aqua	2c	3	7	Flying army planes in the 1920s was a far cry from flying jets today. According to an old copy of &quot;General Rules-to be followed at all United States Flying Fields,&quot; military pilots weren't allowed to wear spurs while flying. Nor were they allowed to ride on the steps, wings, or tails of their machines. Other old rules make one wonder why more planes didn't land in haystacks. There's the encouraging one: &quot;Don't take the airplane up unless you are satisfied it will fly.&quot; And, &quot;Never leave the ground with the motor leaking.&quot; Then, too, pilots were warned not to trust altitude instruments. They were advised to learn to judge altitude, &quot;especially when landing.&quot; Pilots must have been an amazing lot. Not many people today would read, &quot;It is advisable to carry a good pair of cutting pliers where both pilot and passenger can reach them in case of an accident,&quot; and still climb into the cockpit. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:14	1	2003-02-12 17:41:31
212	Aqua	2c	4	7	Sutton Hoo was a country estate in England. The owner of the land asked a museum to send a team of archaeologists to explore some ancient mounds on his property. The explorers used small trowels and toothbrushes as digging tools. One mound showed the outline of an ancient ship. Every grain of earth around the outline was examined. Near the center of the ship the men found the remains of a burial chamber. There was no trace of human bones. But in the chamber were silver bowls from Egypt and fragments of gold set with garnets from India. The metalwork in these ornaments showed fine craftsmanship. Some coins found in the ship date it's burial in about A.D. 650. The archaeologists concluded that what they had found was the burial ship and treasure of an ancient king whose body was probably lost. The importance of Sutton Hoo is what it shows of the life and wealth of the ancient Anglo-Saxons. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:14	1	2003-02-12 17:50:34
213	Aqua	2c	5	7	When sleeping animals whimper, wag their tails, or twitch their whiskers, are they really dreaming? One scientist decided to find out by teaching monkeys to &quot;report&quot; when they saw pictures. The animals were put in a booth before a screen, and their paws were placed on a bar. They were trained to press the bar whenever pictures appeared on the screen. If they failed to press when a picture showed, they got a mild electric shock. Next, the trained monkeys were shut into their booths, and observers watched through a window. No pictures were shown, and eventually the monkeys fell asleep. After a while the observers noticed that the monkeys' eyeballs were moving-a known sign, in humans, that the subject is dreaming. Then the sleeping monkeys, their eyeballs still moving, began pressing the bars in front of them, rapidly and regularly. This told the observers that the animals must be seeing pictures in their sleep-that is, dreaming. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:14	1	2003-02-12 18:01:05
214	Aqua	2c	6	7	The steamship Titanic was eleven stories high and four city blocks long. She was &quot;unsinkable.&quot; On the evening of April 14, 1912, the Titanic was speeding across the North Atlantic on her first voyage. Suddenly an enormous iceberg appeared straight ahead. A lookout grabbed a phone and shouted a warning. &quot;Thank you,&quot; was the answer from the captain's bridge. The giant ice mass grew larger. Finally, the great ship turned-too late. There was a grinding bump as the Titanic scraped the iceberg. Below deck, water began pouring through a 300-foot gash in the side of the ship. &quot;Uncover the lifeboats,&quot; Captain Smith ordered. &quot;Women and children first.&quot; The ship was sinking rapidly as the lifeboats pulled away-but 1600 passengers were still aboard. Toward the end, hundreds leaped into the freezing water, and the &quot;unsinkable&quot; Titanic slipped beneath the sea. Hours later, a steamship picked up the survivors. But more than 1500 people were lost. The sinking of the Titanic shocked the entire world.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:14	1	2003-02-12 18:10:04
215	Aqua	2c	7	7	Today, Knockemstiff. in spite of its hostile name, is a very quiet town in Ohio with a population of four hundred. It was during the Civil War that the community acquired its fighting name. Legend has it that two women began to fight over one man. One day the man took one lady for a walk, and the following day he escorted the other lady to a church picnic. The women lost their tempers and began to fight with each other-fists and all. A minister happened along and broke up the fight. &quot;What you ought to do,&quot; he suggested, &quot;is catch that man and knock him stiff. There's so much fighting around here that you ought to call this place Knockemstiff.&quot; The minister's suggestion was approved. Now, every year or so, some proud citizen wants to change the name to something a little bit fancier. However, to old-timers and mapmakers, the town remains Knockemstiff. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:15	1	2003-02-12 18:18:58
216	Aqua	2c	8	7	The totem poles of the Northwest Coast Indians were not, as some people think, idols to be worshiped. To the Indians, totem poles were like family crests. They told the legend of the owner's descent from the beaver, eagle, wolf, or bear. They were symbols of family wealth and pride. Sometimes they commemorated dead leaders or special events. These North American Indians have carved totem poles for ages. But carving reached its highest development in the years between 1840 and 1880. There were three main reasons for this. This was a time of trade with the white people. The new experiences that the whites brought the Indians stimulated new ideas in their art. Also, iron was introduced to the Indians at this time, and this meant better tools for carving. Finally, the Indians began to trade in sea otter skins. This brought them new wealth and promoted the desire for symbols of this wealth, like totem poles. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:15	1	2004-04-06 11:03:48
217	Aqua	2c	9	7	An Egyptian relic with a strange inscription had an honored place in the London house of Lord Westbury. The relic had been taken from the tomb of King Tutankhamen by Howard Carter, the English archaeologist who had found the tomb. The inscription translated: Death shall come on swift wings to who toucheth the tomb of the Pharaohs. The newspapers called the inscription the Curse of King Tut. Carter's secretary had been Lord Westbury's son. The lord scoffed at the inscription, even though his son had died suddenly and his son's widow had killed herself. Then one day in 1930 Westbury stepped out of a seventh-floor window in his apartment. &quot;The Curse has struck again,&quot; the newspapers declared. Before ten years had passed, fourteen persons connected with the opening of King Tut's tomb had died in some strange manner. Lord Westbury's wife maintained that she didn't believe in such &quot;nonsense.&quot; She died in the late 1930s-at the age of eighty-one. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:15	1	2003-02-12 18:31:33
218	Aqua	2c	10	7	During World War II American spies in a neutral country tapped a line that came out of the German embassy. The Americans could read the German code, and this tap was the source of many military secrets. But one day nothing but nonsense came over the wire. The Germans had put in a new machine; the Americans could not decipher the messages. The American spymaster decided to send someone into the embassy to blow up the machine. At last he persuaded a Turk to undertake the dangerous mission. The Turk's last question was, &quot;How will I know what to blow up?&quot; The spy smiled. &quot;That's easy the machine that looks most complicated.&quot; After a gun battle with the guards, the Turk got into the code room. He slapped the explosive on the largest machine and barely escaped alive. But the next day the Germans' machine was still working. An investigation showed that the Turk had blown up the coffee machine. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:15	1	2003-02-12 18:38:29
219	Aqua	2c	11	7	   Sequoia National Park is the home of the giant sequoia trees. These trees date all the way back to the age of the dinosaurs. The park is the second-oldest national park in the United States. It was established in 1890 to protect the towering trees from destruction by loggers.
 The sequoia tree is the earth's largest living thing-and one of its oldest. It is believed that the first sequoia tree appeared in the Mesozoic era, a hundred million years ago. It is thought that the sequoias were abundant throughout the Northern Hemisphere before the Ice Age. Many of the trees were destroyed by the ice flow, but some survived because they were protected by the high Sierra Nevada that surrounds them. The bark of the sequoia is another of its secrets of survival.
 The bark is sometimes as much as two feet thick. This means that only very long and hot fires can harm the tree. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:15	1	2003-02-25 16:58:01
220	Aqua	2c	12	7	   The first automobile license plate was a small aluminum disk about the size of a half dollar. It was issued by the state of New York in 1901; it cost one dollar.
 Other states soon followed New York's lead. Massachusetts was the first state to require plates on both the front and back of the car, and the city of Philadelphia originated the practice of having motorists buy new plates every year.
 It wasn't until 1956 that all states agreed on a standard size for plates-six by twelve inches. Until that time, some licenses were square, some rounded, and some shaped like states. 
 Even when the standard size was adopted, the states refused to give up their mottoes, slogans, and emblems. Ride the open highway and you'll see that Georgia is &quot;The Peach State,&quot; Illinois the &quot;Land of Lincoln,&quot; and Kansas the &quot;Wheat State.&quot; California has used various symbols-a bear, a mission bell, a poppy, and a star. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:16	1	2003-02-21 14:00:46
221	Aqua	2c	13	7	   Wide-screen &quot;moving pictures&quot; were popular between 1830 and 1880. Hundreds of thousands of people went to see them.
 These moving pictures were called panoramas. They were oil paintings on long strips of canvas, which were unrolled before the audiences. Many of the panoramas took more than two hours to show.
 The canvases were from six to twenty feet high. They were wound on rollers set up on both sides of the stage and moved by a man turning a crank.
 As the paintings were shown, the painter would give information about the cities or events he had painted. The paintings were often accompanied by music. Some was specially composed for the panorama being shown.
 The paintings depicted all sorts of things. One-the &quot;Moving Panorama of New York&quot;-took six men more than four years to paint.
 Newspapers reviewed the opening performances in Boston or New York City. Then the panoramas were taken on the road, where they sometimes played for years. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:16	1	2003-02-21 14:56:12
222	Aqua	2c	14	7	   One of the most-visited spots in America is Mammoth Cave, Kentucky. The world's largest single cave, it has been called one of the wonders of the New World.
 The cave has more than 150 miles of explored corridors on five levels. There are many rock formations, which resemble flowers, fruits, and trees. The cave has two lakes, eight waterfalls, and three rivers. The cave's Echo River is the home of strange, eyeless, colorless fish. 
 Pottery, moccasins, and charred torch sticks indicate that Indians lived in or visited the cave about two thousand years before America was discovered. In 1935 an Indian mummy was found in the cave.
 Legend says that a hunter was the first white man to set foot in the cave. That was probably at the end of the 1700s, and people have been fascinated by Mammoth Cave ever since. 
 On the surface, Mammoth Cave National Park covers more than seventy-nine square miles of wooded, rolling land. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:16	1	2003-02-21 15:02:03
223	Aqua	2c	15	7	   Not far from Salisbury in Southern Rhodesia stand the ruins of Zimbabwe. We know from old stories of the MaKalanga people that Zimbabwe was once the headquarters of their <i>Monomotapa</i>, or powerful chief.
 These ruins are built in the shape of a kraal-a hut village enclosed by a fence. The outer wall of a kraal was usually made of thorns; however, the wall at Zimbabwe was made of stone. 
 The builders of Zimbabwe got their stone from sheets of granite found on the tops of small hills nearby. They broke the sheets of granite into convenient-sized blocks by beating them with stone pounders, and then they placed the stones in layers until the gigantic wall surrounding the town was complete.
 The huts in Zimbabwe were also made of stone. The chief's huts stood on a raised platform in front of a tower of solid stone. This tower was probably used by the <i>Monomotapa</i> when he spoke to the people. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:16	1	2003-02-25 17:02:11
224	Blue	2c	1	7.5	By the middle 1800s, physicians were saving many lives by surgery. But they lost many patients unnecessarily. The fault did not lie with the doctors. The real killer was the infection that so often set in after the operation. Blood poisoning was common. Most doctors thought that infection was the natural risk of major surgery. But one doctor felt differently.
   Joseph Lister believed that some means could be found to guard against blood poisoning and to protect wounds against deadly infection. He thought that airborne bacteria might be the cause of these infections. On August 12, 1865, Lister prepared to operate on a man with a broken leg. To the amazement of his staff, he sprayed the air in the operating room - and the wound itself - with a strong antiseptic. It worked. The leg did not become badly infected. Lister did not stop there. He kept up his fight against infection; he insisted that clean dressings be used on wounds. Today, thanks to Lister, even the most complex surgery does not have to risk an unnecessary penalty from harmful bacteria. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:17	1	2003-02-25 17:04:28
225	Blue	2c	2	7.5	The fish of comparatively few species use their fins for locomotion. Most fish move the lower half of their bodies-not their tail fins-to propel themselves. Marine mammals, such as the porpoise, develop great speed, yet they have no fins at all. The fastest swimmers have streamlined bodies and tail structures capable of developing great power. Fins are used by fish as steering and balancing tools and as brakes. A fish generally uses its fins when it turns or leaps and when it pursues prey or dodges enemies. But the powerful movement of its tail is what furnishes the driving power. Some rather unconventional fish do use their fins primarily for locomotion. The ocean sunfish cannot whip its tail back and forth for propulsion. So it must rely on two long tail fins that it vibrates rapidly in order to move. Trunk fish, enclosed by hard, inflexible cases, are unable to move their bodies and swim only with their fins. None, however, can develop the speed of fish of the species we commonly see. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:17	1	2003-02-13 11:32:52
226	Blue	2c	3	7.5	   By the end of May 1940, German armies had almost completely overrun Europe. Allied troops had been forced to pull back to Dunkirk on the coast of France. But now the Allies were boxed in - the Germans were forcing them toward the beaches and only the sea lay ahead.
   Meanwhile an unusual rescue fleet set out from England. There were motorboats, lifeboats, tugboats, sailboats, channel ferries - almost anything that would float.
   These boats were manned by all sorts of people - bankers, dentists, taxicab drivers, fishermen. Without weapons, they sailed courageously toward Dunkirk while British airplanes dropped bombs to build a barrier of flame between the retreating Allied forces and the Germans who were chasing them. As the boats approached the beaches, soldiers by the thousands waded out to board them. The boats sailed back to England, only to return for more men.
   Dunkirk was a turning point in World War II, for what appeared to be a crushing defeat was transformed into an impressive moral victory. Carried out under the eyes and fire of the enemy, the retreat saved an entire British army.

227	Blue	2c	4	7.5	Hundreds of years ago on several islands in the Indian Ocean there actually lived a bird we call the &quot;dodo.&quot; Since the dodo had no enemies, it had no instinct to defend itself and therefore lacked the ability to fly or run fast. Consequently it developed into a peculiar-looking creature.
   Its body was round and fat, about twice as large as a turkey's.  It's legs were so short that it could scarcely support its own weight and could move only by waddling along slowly. The dodo's tail was a useless little tuft of curly feathers, and its head was very large, ending in an enormous hooked bill. The bird's wings had become very small and couldn't function as wings at all.
   In 1507, Portuguese explorers discovered this strange creature and, since it looked ridiculous and couldn't defend itself, they called it duodo, which means &quot;simpleton.&quot; They discovered that they could knock the awkward birds over with clubs. Later on, men came to the islands with hogs that destroyed the dodo's eggs and young, and by 1681 the bird was extinct. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:17	1	2003-02-25 17:06:30
228	Blue	2c	5	7.5	Early in 1942 Ernie Pyle went to Ireland to send home to the American people a day-by-day written account of the life of the common American soldier.  This was the beginning of Pyle's national fame. He told of the ordinary daily doings of the soldiers, giving the names and addresses of the boys as if he were writing for their hometown newspapers. 
   Ernie followed them to North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and France; he shared their discomforts and dangers; he was slightly injured in one battle and had many more close calls. His newspaper column was read throughout the country, and in 1944 he received the Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence.
    In the fall of 1944 he returned to the United States for a rest, but after a few months he went back to the war-to the Pacific this time, to cover the Okinawa campaign. There - on le Shima on April 18, 1945 - a Japanese sniper's bullet killed the war correspondent. One newspaper headlined the story of Pyle's death in red type: G.I. JOE, YOU'VE LOST ANOTHER FRIEND. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:17	1	2003-09-13 12:38:57
229	Blue	2c	6	7.5	When the United States was a young nation, its lawmakers met in many different cities. The country agreed that a permanent site for the government must be found. This would be much more convenient for Congress and the president. It would also provide the proper setting of dignity for the government of the new nation. At last a site on the Potomac River was chosen. The area was carved out of the states of Maryland and Virginia, but Virginia's land was not used and was given back to that state nearly fifty years later. The name &quot;Territory of Columbia&quot; was chosen for the area, and &quot;City of Washington&quot; for the city. These names were suitable; they honored the discoverer of the country and its first president. Though at first called a territory, the area was called &quot;the District of Columbia&quot; by Congress in 1800 in its first meeting there. And so it has been ever since. Many staves were once territories; but the District of Columbia will never be a state. It belongs to the nation as a whole. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:18	1	2003-02-13 11:47:04
230	Blue	2c	7	7.5	The native American lotus is quite a flower. Its leaves may reach two feet in diameter; its blossoms are pale yellow and fragrant. This beautiful plant used to grow abundantly along the streams, creeks, and rivers in the eastern section of the country. But polluted water and indiscriminate cutting have put the lotus in danger of extinction. The lotus has an interesting history. In ancient poetry there is mention of this flower's being eaten for its narcotic effect. The American lotus must be only distantly related to the ancient plant; it contains protein and vitamins but no narcotic. In fact, the American Indians used to make a meal out of the plant. In the spring, they boiled the tender leaves; later they took the tubers that grow along the plant's roots and baked them like sweet potatoes or dried and stored them for the winter. But now conservationists are concerned with preserving the few remaining lotus plants for their beauty rather than for their food value. It would be a shame to let these lovely flowers vanish from the countryside. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:18	1	2003-02-13 11:50:16
231	Blue	2c	8	7.5	A man named William Gray was responsible for the coin telephone. One day he needed a doctor for his ailing wife. Because he had no phone of his own, he had to use a local merchant's telephone. This gave Gray an idea. Why not have a telephone that everyone could use for a small fee? He convinced the telephone company, and in 1880 the first public telephone pay station opened in Connecticut. An attendant watched the phone and collected charges. Soon small metal boxes were placed beside public telephones. A notice on each box said, &quot;This telephone must not be used unless 5 cents is put in the box-Bell Telephone Company.&quot; But the boxes were not connected to the telephone. So the operator had no way of knowing whether a person had deposited money. Later the boxes were equipped with a button that signaled the operator when a coin had been deposited. At first people opposed paying at all, but they soon got used to the idea. Today people rarely have to travel far to find a public telephone, but public telephones are being replaced more and more by cell phones.		1	2002-11-06 08:36:18	1	2007-04-05 14:59:59
232	Blue	2c	9	7.5	At the turn of the century in the western United States it became more profitable to farm the land with a plow than to graze cattle or horses on it. At that time western Texas was an extensive territory made up of large ranches and of open range. The state of Texas granted its counties leagues of land from the open range for the purpose of development. A league of land was about 4220 acres, and these leagues were made up of sections, a section being 640 acres, or one square mile. Every second section in the grants was set aside as &quot;school&quot; or &quot;railroad&quot; land. Settlers could homestead 160 acres, or one-fourth of a section of the land, but they were required to make improvements and to live there part of every year for five years. At the termination of the fifth year the land was given to the settler who had homesteaded there. Thousands of settlers came to farm the land. And as the range was divided into small farms surrounded with fences, its entire character and appearance changed. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:18	1	2003-02-13 11:58:19
233	Blue	2c	10	7.5	In the western United States, much of the water supply comes from mountain snow. Snow surveyors estimate the amount of water the snow will produce after it has melted. Moving through the mountains by snowmobile, skis, snowshoes, and airplane, the surveyors sample snow depths at 1500 stations every month. They drive a hollow tube through the snow to the earth. The volume of water that the snow will produce is calculated from the weight of the snow in the tube. Where snow-sampling stations are almost inaccessible, pole markers with crossbars have been built. By flying over and counting the number of crossbars showing above the snow, the surveyors can measure the depth of the snow. The combined findings of the sampling stations provide an accurate estimate of the amount of water held in the mountain snow packs. At 250 soil-sampling stations, experts estimate the amount of water in the soil. They can then forecast how much of the melting snow will sink into the earth and how much will run off. This information is invaluable to cities, farms, and industries. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:20	1	2003-02-25 17:09:42
234	Blue	2c	11	7.5	   On the broad, rich bottomland of the Mississippi River, between East St. Louis and Collinsville, Illinois, is a place known as Cahokia Mounds. This large group of mounds-named after a local Indian tribe and located near the town of Cahokia-is the sole aboveground remains of a prehistoric settlement. It is said that it existed from A.D. 900 to 1400. It was probably the largest settlement north of Mexico.
 Originally there were eighty-five mounds, which were arranged in straight lines. They covered an area of about five hundred acres. Now, because of plowing and highway construction, the number of mounds has decreased. However, many mounds have been preserved in the Cahokia Mounds State Park. Some are just a few feet high. The largest is ninety-nine feet high and covers sixteen acres.
 It is thought that these mounds served as foundations for temples and other public buildings. Clustered around the towering temples were small houses made of poles and grass.
 The mounds have flat tops; they are very similar in shape to the Mexican and Central American pyramids. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:20	1	2003-02-25 17:10:05
235	Blue	2c	12	7.5	For many years all the pictures in newspapers or magazines were printed from carved blocks of wood called woodcuts or wood engravings.
 Then artists discovered that they could engrave pictures on copper or steel sheets and use these sheets for printing. Sometimes they scratched the picture into the metal with a sharp tool.
 Another method they used was to put a
layer of wax on the metal and make a picture by cutting away the wax in certain places.  Then they would cover the whole sheet with an acid that dissolved the metal but didn't dissolve the wax. Wherever the wax had been cut away, the acid ate into the metal, leaving the wax-covered areas raised. This process
produced a special kind of engraving called an etching.
 Metal plates engraved or etched by hand are still used at times for the printing of pictures, but now there is a much faster way to engrave pictures on metal plates. This process, called photoengraving, is done with the help of a camera.
 Many of the pictures printed today in
books, magazines, and newspapers are
photoengravings.

236	Blue	2c	13	7.5	   The minting of coins is one of the world's biggest manufacturing enterprises. The U.S. Mint is one of the biggest in the world. Since 1874 it has been authorized by Congress to make coins for other nations.
 The U.S. Mint received its first foreign order from the government of Venezuela in 1876. It was a big order: 12 million coins. The coins must have been satisfactory; Venezuela continued to deal with the U.S. Mint until 1959-ordering 300 million coins in all.
 The mint's outside business was excellent during World War II. Despite the shortage of some metals, the mint turned out almost 2 billion coins in 1945 for foreign nations. The mint has done business with thirty-seven countries. It has turned out zlotys for Poland, francs for France, riyals for Saudi Arabia, piastres for Syria, and satangs for Siam. Many of these foreign coins have U.S. Mint marks. 
 The best customer the U.S. Mint ever had was the Netherlands East Indies, which stopped buying when it became Indonesia in 1949. But between 1941 and 1946 that colony ordered 1.7 billion coins.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:20	1	2007-11-27 19:03:42
237	Blue	2c	14	7.5	   Bear Butte, in the northern section of South Dakota's Black Hills, had great religious significance to the Indians. Many of their myths and legends are associated with the mountain, which they called Mato Paha (Sleeping Bear). The Cheyenne made regular pilgrimages to its slopes-supposedly the source of their sacred arrows-until around 1800, when they were driven out of the area by the Sioux.
 The Sioux took over the mountain as a shrine for their gods and a source of divine knowledge for their chiefs.
 The butte also served as a smoke-signal communications center and an early-warning lookout station. The Cheyenne and the Sioux climbed the mountain to survey the prairie below for enemy tribes. Later the Sioux watched with hatred and misgivings as the wagon trains of the white man crawled westward to invade their hunting grounds.
 In the shadow of Bear Butte, at the council fires of 1857, a young brave vowed vengeance on the whites. Nineteen years later. Crazy Horse-now a powerful chief-led his Sioux against Custer at the Little Big Horn. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:20	1	2007-06-23 09:23:28
238	Blue	2c	15	7.5	   Even though they are eating enough food, many people are starving-because their diets are short on protein.
 The key role of proteins was recognized by chemists in the early nineteenth century. They coined the word protein from the Greek word proteios, which means &quot;holding first place.&quot;
 Proteins are vital because the human digestive tract breaks them down into amino-acids, nature's basic building blocks. These amino acids are absorbed through the walls of the intestinal tract and carried by the blood to the body's tissues. The tissue cells then build their own proteins from the amino-acid building blocks.
 The world's most serious and widespread diet-caused form of protein malnutrition is known as kwashiorkor. This disease mainly affects people in poor lands. Raised on cereals that lack protein, a child will not grow well. However, he might look well fed because of a potbelly, which is a major symptom of kwashiorkor.
 Milk-even in small amounts-helps to prevent or treat protein malnutrition. Where milk is scarce, less expensive substitutes such as soybean flour or fishmeal flour can be used. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:21	1	2003-02-21 15:59:39

   When there is not much human hair to eat, the crickets eat the wool of sheep. Sheep owners have tried to find some creature that will kill the pests. But the barbers must not taste good. Not even birds will eat them.

240	Brown	2c	2	3.5	   Ayers Rock is right in the center of Australia. It is said to be the largest rock in the world. It can be seen from about twenty miles away. It rises 1148 feet in the air. And the distance round its base is more than five miles. The land for miles around the rock is red sand.
   From far away Ayers Rock looks like a huge loaf of red bread. Up close it looks like a whale.
   There are some caves in the rock. Natives once held ceremonies there.

241	Brown	2c	3	3.5	   Halloween is a spooky time. It is said that Halloween began more than two thousand years ago. People were superstitious then. They prayed to a wicked god. He was the god of death. People thought he let dead persons come back to life. He did this only one
night of the year.	
   The people were scared of that night. They wanted to scare away the ghosts. So they built fires.
   Today we build our own kind of fire. We buy a pumpkin. We hollow it out. Then we put a candle in it.

242	Brown	2c	4	3.5	   Millions of years ago dinosaurs roamed the earth. Millions of years
ago the dinosaurs all died. No one knows why.
   One reason might be that, though these creatures were big and strong, they were not very smart. Some weighed tons - and had brains the size of walnuts.
   Too, the earth is always changing. Swamps and streams dry up. The climate may change from warm to cold. Plants that once grew grow no more. Perhaps as the earth changed, dinosaurs could not change with it. And so they all died.

244	Brown	2c	6	3.5	A magician changed a mouse into a beautiful girl. He wanted her to marry the world's strongest creature. He went
to Sun.	
   But Sun said, &quot;Cloud is stronger
than I. He hides me.&quot;
   Cloud said, &quot;Wind is stronger than
I. He moves me.&quot;
   But Wind said, &quot;Mountain is stronger.
He can turn me to rain.&quot;
   Mountain said, &quot;Mouse is stronger
than I, for he nibbles holes in me.&quot;
   Mouse said, &quot;I'd marry her, but she's
too big for my house.&quot;
   So the magician changed the girl
back into a mouse.

245	Brown	2c	7	3.5	   Bread as we know it was baked in about 1500 B.C. - by mistake. As the tale goes, an Egyptian baker forgot to bake some dough; it stood out all night. The next day, the dough was twice the size it had been. The baker put the strange stuff in his oven; he got the first yeast bread.
   From that day on, yeast bread was quite valuable. Bakers began to bake their bread in different shapes. Bread was so prized by kings that they used the fancy loaves for trade.

246	Brown	2c	9	3.5	A postmark on a letter tells what town it was sent from. And it shows what day it was mailed. Postmarks were first used in England in the 1660s. A man named Bishop was in charge of the post office then. He asked his workers to mark the mail as it came into the office. He wanted the mail sent out promptly. When the dates were marked on the letters, he could tell how long they had been in the office. In those days the marks were called Bishop's marks. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:22	1	2003-02-13 12:02:25
247	Brown	2c	10	3.5	Life was hard in early New England. People built their own homes; they grew their own food and made their own clothes. Children helped with the work. Most girls cooked, sewed, and spun wool to weave into cloth. The boys made furniture and tools and did chores on the farm. Even when people gathered to have a good time, they worked. &quot;Husking bees&quot; to take husks off corn and &quot;quilting bees&quot; to make warm quilts brought friends together to have fun and get a job done at the same time. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:22	1	2003-02-13 12:04:20
248	Brown	2c	11	3.5	   In the myths of Rome, Vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods. He made spears and shields and swords for them. He made all their furniture as well.
 He had slaves made of gold. These slaves could move. They helped him to do his work.
 Vulcan worked under the ground. He built huge fires to melt metals. But sometimes these fires got too hot and exploded. This is the way the Romans of that time explained the eruption of a volcano.
 Our word volcano comes from this god's name. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:22	1	2003-02-21 16:06:12
249	Brown	2c	12	3.5	   The people who first lived in the U.S. South built all kinds of homes. The best-known houses in the South were built on plantations. On these large farms cotton or tobacco was grown.
 These houses were large and white. Their huge rooms had high ceilings. The houses were built in this way because it was so hot in the South. The white paint reflected the sun; the high ceilings kept the rooms cool. 
 Most of the houses had wide porches. There people could rest in the shade. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:22	1	2003-02-25 15:18:24
250	Brown	2c	13	3.5	   The year was 1891. Electric lights were put in the White House for the first time.
 That first night President and Mrs. Benjamin Harrison left the lights on. They were scared to turn them off; they thought they might get a shock. The next day the electrician came. He turned the lights off.
 For a long time the rooms in the White House stayed dark. The President and his wife would not turn the lights on. They would not even use the electric bells that called the maids. They still did not trust electricity. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:22	1	2003-02-21 16:10:19
251	Brown	2c	14	3.5	   Pipe Spring National Monument covers forty acres of land in Arizona. On this land there is a fort. It is made of stones and logs. It has just one gate.
 Inside the fort is a spring; it is called Pipe Spring. Fresh water flows from it all the time. It is the only spring for miles. The rest of the land is dry.
 In the 1860s the area's Indians were not friendly. The settlers built Pipe Spring Fort around the spring. The fort helped them to guard their water supply. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:23	1	2003-02-21 16:11:29
252	Brown	2c	15	3.5	   The Chimu people lived on the north coast of Peru many years ago. That part of the land was a hot, dry desert. But there were a few small streams that ran through it. The Chimu used all of the good soil by the streams to grow beans and corn.
 The Chimu built their homes on the rocky or sandy part of the land. The walls of all the houses were made of clay bricks. These bricks were carved with lovely patterns. And the walls were painted in bright colors. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:23	1	2003-02-21 16:13:29
253	Gold	2c	6	5	Some scientists think that we would be more active if we slept better. To test this theory, a group of Russian scientists worked with a sixteen-year-old white spaniel named Mika. These men put the tired old dog into a deep sleep for three months. During her long sleep Mika was fed through tubes that led into her veins. Though she could hardly-crawl around before the sleep, Mika awoke bright-eyed and alert. She was soon-standing on her hind legs. She also began to chase cats. She lived to be twenty-three. That is 50 percent longer than the normal lifespan of a dog. Even then Mika did not die of old age. She died in a fight with a monkey. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:23	1	2003-02-13 12:07:02
254	Gold	2c	7	5	After the elephant, the hippopotamus is the largest land mammal. It is very heavy and bulky. It does not live for a long time out of water. Water helps hold up its weight. It also needs water to keep its thick skin from getting dry and scaly.
   People used to think that the hippo &quot;sweated blood&quot; when out of the water. Now we know what really happens. A reddish, oily perspiration comes out of pores in its two-inch-thick skin. This liquid protects its hide from the drying effects of the air for a short time. When the hippo is upset, hurt, or too warm, the red fluid flows faster. It is redder in color. But this fluid is not blood. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:23	1	2003-02-25 17:12:55
255	Gold	2c	8	5	Hundreds of bombers roared over the English Channel. The Germans were trying to soften England for an invasion. But the Germans did not know the strength of the people they were fighting. The British stayed calm and firm. They had worked out a good defense against the air raids. They used radar. And spotters watched the skies day and night. But most important of all was the Royal Air Force-the RAF. These few hundred young pilots rose to the challenge. In three months they handed the Germans their first big defeat of World War II. Speaking of the pilots, Winston Churchill said, &quot;Never in the Field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.&quot; 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:23	1	2003-02-13 12:11:55
256	Gold	2c	9	5	Barbed wire was invented in 1873. It was made of sharp metal diamonds that were held in place between two tightly twisted strands of wire. Since then more than four hundred different kinds of barbed wire have been developed. In the early days barbed wire caused many fights. The fights occurred when cattlemen found grazing land blocked by another man's barbed-wire fences. In those days the barbs were long; they could cause terrible wounds. Cattle sometimes died after running into a barbed-wire fence. Today barbed wire is not as dangerous. The barbs are shorter, and the wire is thicker and easier to see. Each year the United States uses about one and a half million miles of barbed wire. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:23	1	2003-02-13 12:14:16
257	Gold	2c	10	5	   The people of ancient Rome liked to keep up with the news. Julius Caesar knew this. When he became one of Rome's rulers, he had each day's news posted on a public bulletin board.
   The Romans gathered to read and discuss the news. They learned about the decisions of the courts; they read the speeches of their senators. Births, deaths, and marriages were listed on the board; so were sports events and crimes.
   Caesar also sent the news of Rome to her colonies; this made the people there feel that they were a part of Rome.
   But the Romans did not learn everything that went on in the government. They got only the news that Caesar wanted them to have.

258	Gold	2c	11	5	   The akita is the royal dog of Japan. Until the end of World War II, these dogs were considered a national treasure; they could not be taken out of the country. But after the war, some of the American soldiers who had served in Japan brought these dogs back to the United States.
   Akitas have webbed feet. They swim well. They have keen sight and hearing, good noses, and more strength than sled dogs. Besides being quick to learn, these dogs are loyal and protective.	
   Akitas can be traced back to 5000 B.C. It was then that the dogs were brought to Japan from China. The bones of these dogs have been found in the tombs of ancient emperors.

259	Gold	2c	12	5	   New York City has many docks where foreign ships bring their cargoes. The U.S. government charges other countries taxes for bringing their goods into the country. These taxes are called customs duties.
 But New York has a free port. It's on Staten Island. It was the first free port in the country. There customs duties are not charged right away. Shippers like this method. They can land their cargoes and take out bad goods. They can hold their goods there until prices go up. They can ship their goods to other places in the States before paying. If they decide to send their goods to some other country, they don't have to pay any U.S. customs duties. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:24	1	2003-02-21 16:15:01

 A voice commanded, &quot;Stick 'em up!&quot; The colonel recognized the voice. It was that of an old bandit named Shang Doland, whom the colonel had saved from jail on two occasions.
 &quot;Why, Shang,&quot; said the colonel, &quot;aren't you ashamed to rob this poor railroad? Folks with money ride the Iron Mountain.&quot;
 Doland pulled off his mask. &quot;Colonel, I never would have stopped this train if I'd known it was yours.&quot; He rounded up his men and left.
 A few nights later a northbound Iron Mountain train was robbed. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:24	1	2003-02-25 21:57:15
262	Gold	2c	15	5	   A chain of coral-reef islands-or keys-extends west from the tip of Florida. The last seven islands in this chain were discovered by Ponce de Leon in 1513. He found many turtles there. So he named the keys Las Tortugas-the turtles. Sailors later called the keys the Dry Tortugas. This served to warn other seamen that they would not find fresh water there.
 The treasure ships of Spain sailed near those keys. The ships were filled with gold from the mines of South America. Many pirates also sailed near the Dry Tortugas; they hoped to steal the Spanish gold.
 Florida-and the keys-became a part of the United States in 1821; the pirates were forced to leave. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:25	1	2003-02-21 16:25:12
263	Green	2c	5	6	Trumpets have sounded throughout history. Four thousand years ago Moses probably sounded the shofar to help direct the Hebrews' escape from Egypt. The shofar is a ram's horn. It is heard in synagogues today. Four hundred years before the birth of Christ, a horn called the salpinx was used in Greece. Trumpet competition was an important part of the Olympic games of that time. The ancient Romans used the buccina, an ancestor of our tuba. It was used by the night watchman. He blew it to sound the hours and announce that all was well. In England a buccina is called a town horn. In one village, it is still blown every night at nine o'clock. The Vikings used trumpets to signal from one ship to another. Today, in army camps all over the world, a blast from a bugle awakens the troops. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:25	1	2003-02-13 12:16:27
264	Green	2c	6	6	Charlie Parkhurst drove stagecoaches for nearly twenty years in California and was considered one of the finest drivers in the West. Charlie was skillful, brave, and cool-headed. Once the famous driver was going across a bridge and felt it begin to shiver. Instantly the horses felt the whip; they leaped as they had never leaped before. The coach made the other shore as the bridge collapsed. Charlie was stopped by robbers only twice. The first time there was no gun in the coach, and the robbers took the gold. The second time Charlie was ready, fired a shotgun at the leader, and was gone before the gang knew what had happened. After that, thieves left this particular driver alone. Finally at sixty-Charlie retired. In 1879 the driver died. Then people learned a well-kept secret: Charlie Parkhurst was a woman. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:25	1	2004-11-09 15:43:56
265	Green	2c	7	6	On October 20, 1956, Hannes Lindemann set out on a strange sea voyage. His goal was to cross the Atlantic Ocean in his tiny boat. The boat was only seventeen feet long. It was piloted by a crew of one-himself. He sailed from the harbor town of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. During the entire trip he was alone at sea. He rarely slept for longer than an hour at a time. He fought against the winds, the storms, thirst, and hunger. After seventy-two days he reached his destination-the harbor town of Philipsburg on St. Martin in the West Indies. He was rewarded for his effort. He had achieved a historic &quot;first&quot; in man's ancient battle against the sea. Never before had the vast Atlantic Ocean been crossed in so small a boat, piloted by one man alone. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:25	1	2004-11-06 08:54:04
266	Green	2c	8	6	On August 10, 1628, Sweden's largest warship, the Wasa, was ready to make her first voyage. The Wasa, named after the ruling family, was the most heavily armed ship ever built in Sweden. She carried sixty-four guns and a crew of more than four hundred. The Wasa cast off from a dock near the Royal Palace. When she cleared the harbor, her sails were set. But a few hundred yards out, a sudden squall heeled her so far over that water rushed in through her lower gun ports. The pride of the Swedish navy went to the bottom, and about thirty people drowned. . The Wasa was pulled up from the bottom of the sea in 1961. Today the ship is undergoing an intricate drying-out process that will prevent her wooden hull from shrinking or cracking.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:25	1	2005-05-06 19:06:41
267	Green	2c	9	6	Between the Pelorus Sound and the Tasman Bay near New Zealand there is a dangerous stretch of water known as the French Pass. In 1871 the captain of the Brindle noticed a porpoise leaping ahead of his schooner as the ship went through the pass. By following the porpoise, the captain made a safe passage where he had expected trouble. For the next forty years the porpoise Pelorus Jack-led ships through the dangerous waters. Often he'd frolic alongside the ship, but when it neared the French Pass he'd leap ahead. Once someone on the ship Penguin shot Jack. He disappeared for two weeks, but then returned as eager as ever. Still Jack was no fool. He never again guided the Penguin. Pelorus Jack has not been forgotten. A statue of this amazing porpoise now stands in Wellington, New Zealand. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:26	1	2003-02-13 14:05:12
268	Green	2c	10	6	   One of baseball's most memorable games took place on May 2, 1917, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Chicago Cubs. It was one of baseball's greatest pitching duels. But, more important, it was the first major league game in history in which both teams completed nine hitless innings.   
 Huge Fred Toney was on the mound for the Reds. His bitter rival, Jim &quot;Hippo&quot; Vaughn, was pitching for the Cubs.   
 Zero after zero was recorded on the scoreboard. Neither team got a hit or scored a run. After nine full innings of play, both pitchers had hurled no-hitters-a historic pitching achievement. 
 In the tenth, Toney pitched another hitless inning. But in the last half of the tenth, Vaughn faltered. One hit and one error later, the game was over. The Cubs lost by a score of 1 to 0. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:26	1	2003-02-25 17:15:34
269	Green	2c	11	6	   Vidkun Quisling was born in Norway in 1887. He spent some years in the army, then entered politics. In the 1930s, he formed his own party. By the time World War II broke out, he had attained great power.
 The Germans invaded Norway in 1940; Quisling helped them to take over his country. For his efforts, he was put in charge of the government. While he was premier. Quisling carried out brutal measures to stop the resistance movement of the Norwegians who fought against the Germans who occupied their country.
 In 1945, two days before Germany fell, Quisling was arrested by resistance leaders. He was charged with treason. He was found guilty and shot.
 Because of this man, a new word came into the English language. A <i>quisling</i> is a traitor who gives aid to the invaders of his country. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:26	1	2003-02-25 17:16:30
270	Green	2c	12	6	   Why do hurricanes have girls' names? It all started in 1941. A college professor named George Stewart wrote a novel called <i>Storm</i>. The best-selling book told how a small weather disturbance off the coast of Japan could become a raging storm by the time it swept through the United States. In the book a young weatherman traced the storm; he called it Maria for a girl he knew.
 Someone in the U.S. Weather Bureau must have read the book, for calling hurricanes by girls' names became the unofficial practice shortly afterward. The U.S. military personnel of World War II also used this system to brand storms.
 The practice became official in 1953. Now girls' names are listed in alphabetical order clear down to Z. The storms are named by the weather bureau as soon as they are born.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:26	1	2003-02-25 17:17:42
271	Green	2c	13	6	   In the nineteenth century, relics of prehistoric man were turning up in Europe. Human skulls, bones, and tools were being found in caves, riverbeds, and lake bottoms.
 In 1836 a man named Christian Thomson was working on a museum exhibit of some of these relics. He worked out a plan to classify them. The plan was called the Three Age System. It was set up according to the material from which the tools in each group of relics were made.
 The ages are the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. They overlap, for warriors often used bronze weapons while their tools were still made of stone.
 The plan is no guide to exact dates, because people reached different stages of development at different times. For instance, there are people today who still live at the Stone Age level.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:27	1	2003-02-21 16:57:25
272	Green	2c	14	6	   During World War II thousands of bats were drafted into the Armed Services. They were tested to see whether they could act as a special bombing squad.
 A one-ounce time bomb was harnessed to each bat. Then the bats were packed into large crates, and the crates were loaded into airplanes.
 When the target point was reached, the crates were' dropped by parachute. The crates opened automatically at one thousand feet above the ground, freeing the bats. The bats flew to the nearest roosting place. They chewed off their harnesses, and then they flew away. The bombs were left behind, and after a certain length of time, they exploded.
 The practice tests are known to have been a success. But whether the bats were really used during the war to bomb enemy territory is still a military secret. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:27	1	2003-02-21 16:59:57
273	Green	2c	15	6	   On July 15, 1933, Wiley Post left Floyd Bennett Field in New York on a solo flight round the world. His plane, the <i>Winnie Mae</i>, was equipped with two new instruments. The automatic pilot was to hold Post's airplane on course for half an hour, thus allowing the pilot to rest. The directional compass would help in navigating the plane.
 Post flew from New York to Berlin, Germany, before stopping for food and rest. There the new instruments broke. And on the next leg of the trip he ran into bad weather. Three times he was on the verge of parachuting out. Once his plane nosed over when landing, but repairs were quickly completed.
 Post landed in New York seven days, eighteen hours, and forty-nine minutes after he left. He was the first pilot to fly round the world alone.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:27	1	2003-02-21 17:06:20
274	Olive	2c	6	5.5	   The world's longest underground highway runs between France and Italy. It is an engineering marvel. And it is a triumph over those who said it couldn't be done. The roadbed was cut through solid granite. Workmen had to face tons of sliding clay. There were icy floods from underground streams.    
 The tunnel is seven and a half miles long. Every thousand feet there are bays for emergency repairs, phones, and washrooms. The flow of traffic is controlled; just 450 cars an hour may enter the tunnel. Seven huge pumps constantly replace stale air with fresh air from the outside. 
 Before the road was built, cars had to follow winding routes through the mountains. Now drivers spend about fourteen minutes on a trip that used to take twenty hours. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:27	1	2003-02-13 14:59:53

 The award was first made in 1927. It had no name then; it was just called the &quot;statuette.&quot; There are several stories of how it got its name. One goes like this:         
 In 1931 Mrs. Margaret Herrick came to work in the Academy's library. On her first day she saw one of the statuettes.  
 &quot;He reminds me,&quot; she said, &quot;of my Uncle Oscar.&quot; A newsman heard what she said. He reported it in his column. He wrote, &quot;Employees have dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar.'&quot;

276	Olive	2c	8	5.5	It must be the rarest of American crimes pulling the President's nose. The nose was Andrew Jackson's and the puller was an ex-Navy lieutenant, Robert Randolph. Randolph had been accused of stealing while serving on a ship. He had been dismissed from his job on an order signed by Jackson.         
 One day in 1833, Randolph went aboard a steamboat on which the President was traveling. Jackson looked up from his reading to see a stranger drawing off his glove. Jackson offered to shake hands. So Randolph thrust out his hand-and pulled the President's nose. Randolph got free from those who tried to seize him, ran down the gangplank, and escaped. Jackson was furious, but he refused to bring charges. Thus Randolph not only tweaked the President's nose, but got away with it. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:28	1	2003-02-25 17:18:34
277	Olive	2c	9	5.5	   All animals are thought to have come from the sea to the land. But there are some animals that went back to live in the sea. 
 Fossils suggest that the ancestors of whales were mammals that lived on the land. They were probably huge beasts with powerful jaws and teeth. Scientists think these mammals fed on fish and other marine animals. They caught the fish at the edges of the ocean or on the banks of river deltas.  
 Perhaps over the years these land animals followed their food into deeper and deeper water. As time passed, the bodies of these land beasts changed so that they could live in the sea. For instance, their front legs became flippers. These beasts developed into the whales, sea lions, and sea elephants that we know today. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:28	1	2003-02-13 15:23:24
278	Olive	2c	10	5.5	   In September of 1934 the Queen Mary was launched. She was the most gracious ship on the seas. The majestic black-and-white ship was topped by three huge funnels of red and black. She was close to 1500 feet in length; she had room for movie theaters, swimming pools, and many shops. Gardeners took care of the flowers in the &quot;garden lounges.&quot;  
 During World War II the Queen Mary was used as a troopship. She and her sister ship, the Queen Elizabeth, were first used to carry Australian troops to the Middle East. Later in the war, thousands of American troops were carried to Great Britain in safety. Many people believe that the war was over more quickly because of the work done by the Queen Mary and her sister. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:28	1	2003-02-13 15:30:46
279	Olive	2c	11	5.5	   Outside most pawnshops are three golden globes. No one knows where this symbol for the pawnbroker came from. But there are several theories.
 One theory gives credit to the Lombards, a merchant family who came to London in the 1300s. The Lombards were moneylenders as well as merchants. And the insigne of the family was three gold coins.
 A second version is less believable but more romantic. It gives credit to St. Nicholas. The saint, so the tale goes, once met a poor man whose three daughters could not marry for lack of money. That night the good saint tossed three bags of gold into the bedroom of the girls. This gave them the means to get married.
 Today St. Nicholas is sometimes thought of as the patron saint of pawnbrokers. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:28	1	2003-02-21 19:46:34
280	olive	2c	12	5.5	   One morning a man told his barber that he wanted a particularly good haircut. &quot;I'm flying to England tomorrow to meet the queen.&quot;     
 Unimpressed, the barber commented, &quot;In the first place, English weather is terrible, and in the second place, you'll hate the food. In the third place, you won't really meet the queen. There'll be hundreds of people in the room.&quot;
 A few weeks later the man was back in the barber's chair. &quot;In the first place,&quot; he reported, &quot;the weather was magnificent, and in the second place, I liked the food so much I gained fifteen pounds. In the third place, there were only two other visitors at the palace. And do you know what the queen asked me? 'Who on earth gave you that horrible haircut?&quot;' 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:28	1	2003-04-15 16:16:16
281	Olive	2c	13	5.5	   In colonial America, the towns had no police departments. The only lawmen were the watch and the ward. The men on the watch patrolled the streets at night; the ward made the rounds during the day. But these were not trained policemen.
 Nor were there police on the western frontier. For many years in the Old West, the only law was the town marshal. These marshals often appointed themselves to the job.
 The first regular U.S. police force was formed in Boston in about 1838. There were six men on the force. New York City set up a small force about six years later.
 These first policemen did not wear special uniforms, and some would not wear badges. It was not until 1856 that New York policemen wore full uniforms. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:29	1	2003-02-25 17:19:28
282	Olive	2c	14	5.5	   Spectators at the 1912 Indianapolis 500 automobile race were certain that Ralph DePalma would win. He had led for 495 miles of the 500-mile race. Only an unforeseen disaster could stop him from winning.
 Then it happened. Going into the last 2.5-mile lap DePalma's car suddenly stopped. Determined not to give up, DePalma jumped out of his car and began to push it.
 As he pushed, cars whizzed by at speeds close to a hundred miles an hour, but DePalma didn't seem to mind. He slowly made his way toward the finish line.
 DePalma's car crossed the line just before Joe Dawson, the man in second place, roared past. But the prize went to Dawson. There is a rule that the winning car has to cross the finish line under its own power.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:29	1	2003-02-25 17:20:03
283	Orange	2c	1	4.5	People have always been afraid of quicksand. And their fear is justified. In 1878 a train was derailed. It plunged into quicksand and disappeared. Animals often die in a fight with quicksand. Trees and buildings have been known to sink in quicksand. 
 Quicksand is formed when water rises from underground and mixes with sand. Falling into this sand is like falling into water. Most people sink just to their shoulders; then they float. It is when they kick and thrash that the sand drags them down. 
 The best way to fight quicksand is not to fight. The person caught in the sand should stay still until help arrives. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:29	1	2003-02-13 15:33:11
284	Orange	2c	2	4.5	   Of all the dogs in the world, the one with the best sense of smell is the bloodhound. This big, sad-eyed dog has won great fame by helping the police track down criminals and lost people. It follows their scent along the ground to find them. This dog's work has even been accepted as evidence in a court of law.  
 One of the most famous bloodhounds of all time was named Nick Carter. It tracked down more than 600 criminals.  
 Because of its name, some people think that the bloodhound is a mean dog. But it is kind and gentle. It will not harm anyone, not even the criminal it hunts. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:29	1	2003-02-13 15:35:45
285	Orange	2c	3	4.5	   There is a tiny town called Safety Village in Tampa, Florida. It was built so that safety rules could be taught to small children. 
 The town takes up about one acre of land. It looks much like Tampa but on a small scale. The town has its own city hall and courthouse. It has a gas station, fire station, school, and office buildings. And it has sidewalks, streetlights, and traffic signs. 
 There are about twenty-four small cars for the children to drive. But not all children drive at the same time; they are divided into two groups-the pedestrians and the drivers. Each child has a chance to play both parts. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:29	1	2003-02-25 17:20:48
286	Orange	2c	4	4.5	   The pika is a tiny animal that lives in the mountains. It is related to the rabbit. It lives on grass and plants during the summer. But it has to store up food for the long winter.  
 In the fall the pika carries bundles of stems and short grasses to its home. It spreads them out to dry in the sun. Then it packs them away for the winter in a crack between rocks. This way the wind and snow can't harm them. 
 When the snow has covered the mountains, the pika simply runs out of its warm burrow to its storage place and eats all the food it wants. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:29	1	2003-02-13 15:39:31
287	Orange	2c	5	4.5	   It was noon, November 7, 1918. The news flash said that World War I was over, that an armistice had been signed. The news spread fast. Offices and schools emptied, and New York had its first ticker-tape &quot;snow.&quot; 
 But something was wrong. Washington knew nothing about an armistice. The reports were false. 
 How did it happen? One newsman had a theory. A German spy, he said, had sent the message. The Germans hoped Allied leaders would then be forced to make a quick peace. 
 On November 11 there was ticker-tape snow again. This time it was true. An armistice had been signed. But much of the joy had already been spent. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:30	1	2004-10-09 10:39:21
288	Orange	2c	6	4.5	   Christopher Columbus once saved his life because he knew just when there would be an eclipse of the moon.
   In 1504 he was marooned for many weeks on the island of Jamaica. The natives were unfriendly. They would not give him food. Columbus warned them that if they did not feed him, he would &quot;turn off the light in the sky at night.&quot; His almanac had told him that on the night of February 29 there would be a total eclipse of the moon.
   When the eclipse occurred, the natives were struck with terror. They gave Columbus all the food he needed and begged him, in return, to give them back their light.

289	Orange	2c	7	4.5	    In India, legend has it, the animals and the birds were once at war. The bat could not decide which side to join. It could fly, but its body was like an animal's. When it seemed that the animals had won, the bat flew to them and said, &quot;I am an animal like you. I will stay with you.&quot; 
 After the bat joined the animals, the birds came back and defeated them. The bat thought just of saving itself; it hid in a tree. 
 The story says that now both animals and birds hate the bat. That is why it hides during the day and flies only at night.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:30	1	2003-02-13 16:02:51
290	Orange	2c	8	4.5	   A large circle of stones has stood since ancient times on the Salisbury Plain in England.  It is called Stonehenge. Long ago it was a temple of sun worship. Most of the stones that once formed a roof over the temple have fallen.  Two stones - each twenty-two feet high - have also fallen. These two blocks used to stand above a flat stone, which is thought to have been an alter.
 Some of the stones are made of the sandstone found in that area. Other blocks, called the &quot;blue stones&quot;, come from a place 150 miles away. It is still not known how these stones were moved such a long distance.

291	Orange	2c	10	4.5	   There's a white oak tree in Athens, Georgia, that owns itself. Or, at least, it owns the land it grows on.   
 The property has been in the tree's family since 1820. In that year Colonel W. H. Jackson recorded a deed that gave an oak tree the land it grew on. The new landowner flourished. It rose to one hundred feet; its trunk grew to be five feet across. 
 A storm tore the tree down in 1942. But someone saved an acorn and planted it. The young oak is now thirty feet high. It has a limb spread of some twenty-one feet-about the size of the plot it inherited from its parent. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:30	1	2003-02-13 17:26:36
292	Orange	2c	11	4.5	In the 1600s and 1700s Spanish missions were built in Texas. These missions were built so that the priests could live with the Indians and teach them the ways of the Spanish.
 The church was the most important part of the mission. But there were other buildings, too. A high wall was built around the whole mission. Within the walls there were rooms for the priests and small homes for the Indians. There were also kitchens, dining rooms, and workshops.
 Outside the walls were fields and grazing lands. Each mission was supplied with large herds of cows, sheep, and goats. Beans, corn, pumpkins, and watermelons were grown in the fields. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:31	1	2007-06-02 10:40:07

 The nostrils of Old World monkeys open downward. The nostrils of those in the New World open to the front and sides.
 The thumbs of the Old World monkeys can be used to grasp things. The thumbs of the New World monkeys are not as useful. But New World monkeys can hold on to things and swing from branch to branch with their tails. None of those in the Old World . can do this.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:31	1	2003-02-21 20:01:11
294	Orange	2c	13	4.5	 A hundred years ago it was hard work to take a bath. It was uncomfortable, too. At times it was even dangerous. 
 The lack of running water was a big problem. Usually water was heated and carried to the tub. Some tubs were made of marble; they were cold even after hot water was put in.
 Then water heaters were attached to tubs. But they smoked and flamed; sometimes they blew up.
 One unusual tub of the 1800s was the cradle tub. It was hung like a hammock between two posts; it rocked the bather as he washed. However, it sometimes rocked a bit too much-and threw him out. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:31	1	2003-11-11 07:07:18

 In 1899 a new speed record was set in Europe. It was set by a man who was driving an electric racer shaped like a cigar. The car was driven at a speed of 65.79 miles an hour.
 In those days, it took two months to charge the batteries of an electric car. And the charge was used up in a few minutes.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:31	1	2007-06-02 10:40:55
296	Orange	2c	15	4.5	 Louis XIV liked silver. When he became king of France, almost all the things that had been made of wood were remade in silver. This meant that things like tables and chairs were made of silver.
 Since the king used silver so much, all the people liked to use it too. But then bad times came. People had much less money. Most of the silver objects were put into pots and melted down to make money.
 So many of the silver objects were put into melting pots that today there are few of these silver pieces left. Most of those that do exist are found in museums.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:31	1	2003-02-21 20:10:59

 The pinata is hung from the ceiling. Then a child is blindfolded and given a stout stick. He is led to the pinata. While the crowd cheers, he swings the club at the jar. He tries to smash it so that the hidden treats will fall. When the jar is broken, the children share the gifts and candy. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:31	1	2003-02-13 17:59:01
298	Red	2c	7	4	   The hognose snake is very strange. When it is bothered it hisses, puffs up, and strikes. But it doesn't bite. It is just trying to scare its enemies. Because it puffs up so much, this snake is sometimes called the puff adder. 
 If all of its attempts to seem dangerous fail, the hognose rolls over and plays dead. 
 The hognose has a hard nose that helps it catch toads, its favorite food. In fact, some of these snakes eat nothing but toads. 
 The common hognose is from two to three feet long. It is harmless and makes a good pet. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:32	1	2003-02-25 20:39:54

His capital, Knossos, was one of the first big cities. His large navy kept him in power. His huge ships sailed the seas to trade; they brought many riches to Crete. 
 Crete had one of the richest and the strongest empires in the world. The Cretans lived a life of ease and pleasure. 
 But one day the empire fell; it was no more. And to this day no one knows why. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:32	1	2003-02-25 20:41:26

 The first good glass mirrors were made in Venice. They were very small. They cost a lot of money. Ladies wore them as jewelry. 
 Soon the French learned to make mirrors. They made bigger and better ones than the Venetians had. One king had a long row of mirrors covering a whole wall in his palace.

301	Red	2c	10	4	   A horse chestnut is thought to be a good-luck charm. 
 This belief began in the Far East. The people there noticed many things that seemed to link the chestnut tree with the horse. When the leaves fell, scars in the shape of horseshoes were left on the twigs. And the buds of the tree looked like horses' feet. 
 People saw, too, that the chestnut tree lived longer than most trees. Chestnuts were fed to horses so that they might have long lives. 
 In time these nuts were considered medicine-and good luck-for people as well. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:32	1	2003-02-13 18:10:45
302	Red	2c	11	4	 The Shang kings of ancient China were buried in deep pits. All the things a king used in daily life were placed in his tomb. The people thought that he would need these things in the next world. Horses, dogs, and all kinds of pets were buried with him. Many clothes of fine silk were placed in the tomb. Chariots, bronze pots, and jade weapons were also included for the king's use.
 It is from the things that have been found in tombs that we can form a picture of what life was like in China in 1500 B.C.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:32	1	2003-02-21 20:12:24

They killed the pigs, sheep, and cows for the farmers. They went to fairs and cattle sales, too. And as they went from place to place, they took notes from one friend to another. 
 The butchers just took the mail of the common people. The rulers of the land had their own mail service. They had laws to protect their mailmen. And these same laws protected the butchers. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:32	1	2004-09-04 10:30:21

307	Silver	2c	1	8	   One spring day in 1816 a young French physician, Rene Theophile Laennec, was relaxing in a Paris park. Suddenly a new sound caught his attention. The longer he listened, the more significant the sound became. Two children were tapping messages to each other from the opposite ends of a hollow log. 
 Dr. Laennec remembered the hollow-log incident the next time a heart patient visited his office. He made a makeshift tube from a piece of paper. He listened. To his medically trained ears came the sound of a beating heart. He had never before heard this sound so clearly and distinctly. That little paper tube and the beating heart gave the ingenious doctor an idea.
 He constructed a wooden stethoscope. Then in 1819 he published an essay; it included information on all the heart and lung sounds he had discovered with his wooden stethoscope. Dr. Laennec ushered in an era of medical diagnosis in the field of auscultation-the art of listening for sounds in the chest, abdomen, and other parts of the body to determine abnormal conditions. 
 The medical profession owes a great deal to Dr. Laennec. But for his ingenuity, the art of diagnosis could never have advanced so rapidly. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:33	1	2003-02-13 18:14:53
308	Silver	2c	2	8	   The desert has many of nature's most curious creatures. One resident has not changed much in appearance or habits for well over 300 million years. 
 Hadrurus arizonensis is this character's name, but he's usually called the giant hairy scorpion. Although he has many cousins all over the world, &quot;Hairy&quot; is restricted mostly to the desert of the southwestern United States. Even though he looks villainous enough, Hairy is not really one of the West's most dangerous outlaws. Two of his close relatives are deadly, but Hairy's sting isn't much worse than a wasp sting.
 Hairy, the oldest of the scorpions, was probably the first to develop one of our habits-breathing. However, he can get along with little air and is sometimes found buried five feet deep in the desert sand, where he digs for water. 
 Hairy is not only old, but rather backward. When it comes to intelligence, scientists say he has just about the lowest imaginable. Yet, though most prehistoric creatures have changed or become extinct. Hairy is about the same old Hairy that roamed the desert millions of years ago. Considering how long he's been around, perhaps the old guy isn't really as stupid as we believe. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:33	1	2006-04-24 16:35:11
309	Silver	2c	3	8	   A bit of ground meat and a dash of spice-from these ingredients, a popular food and a big industry were created. 
 It started in 1852 when an Austrian sausage maker created a sausage named Wien, for Vienna. Little did he realize that more than a century later Americans would eat an annual average of eighty hotdogs each. 
 Eighty times a population of about 200 million is quite a string of hotdogs! If placed end to end, there would be enough to make two round trips to the moon and then circle the earth more than fourteen times. 
 But if it hadn't been for a St. Louis baker who devised a bun to flank the frank, the wiener might never have made it to the supermarkets- let alone to the moon. 
 In 1904 at the St. Louis Exposition, a vendor provided his customers with white gloves to protect their hands while eating the heated, dachshund-shaped sausage-but profits disappeared along with the gloves the customers took away. 
 The vendor's brother-in-law, a baker, came to the rescue by creating the bun that resulted in the delightful combination that someone later called the &quot;hotdog.&quot; It also saved the vendor from financial disaster. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:33	1	2003-02-13 18:24:29
310	Silver	2c	4	8	   During the Civil War many southern newspapers were unable to stay in operation. One, however, the Memphis Appeal, managed to flee its home city just before the Yankees came in. Its press and type were loaded on a flatcar and taken to Mississippi, where it continued publishing for the Confederate cause. Routed out again and again by the approach of the Northern armies, it gained the nickname &quot;Moving Appeal.&quot;
 It was suddenly forced from one refuge in Jackson, Mississippi, by shellfire announcing the approach of General Sherman. The Appeal crossed the Pearl River while the shells dropped around the press. On the Southern Railway it fled to Atlanta, where it was issued for about a year, getting out of that city just before General Sherman marched in. It was published thereafter in Montgomery, Alabama, and several Georgia towns, finding itself once more squarely in the path of Sherman's march to the sea. Despairing, its editor. Colonel Benjamin Franklin Dill, loaded a proof press on a mule's back, put some type in his saddlebags, and took to the mountains. The bluecoats finally took him prisoner near Columbus, Georgia. 
The Appeal had been published in ten towns and four states. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:34	1	2003-02-13 18:27:26
311	Silver	2c	5	8	   The roadrunner is an exceptional and spectacular member of the bird family. For one thing, it chooses to run instead of fly and, for another thing, it is commonly credited with killing and eating scorpions, centipedes, tarantulas, and rattlesnakes. 
 The most interesting mannerism of the roadrunner develops from the way it uses its enormous tail-which is longer than its body. When running, it holds its head down with its tail directly out behind. When it makes a fast stop, its head and tail go up, and then the tail goes alternately up and down. The roadrunner is an awkwardly built creature with a big, heavy head, and would be off balance except for its tail. It moves its tail up and down to prevent toppling forward or backward. 
 It has been said that the roadrunner was a cuckoo left over on the desert as the oceans receded, and that it soon adapted itself to this new environment. It ran because there was no place to fly, and it developed an appetite for obnoxious varmints because there wasn't anything else to eat. 
 The roadrunner may be cuckoo, but New Mexico is proud to claim this spectacular creature as its state bird. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:34	1	2003-02-13 18:31:00
312	Silver	2c	6	8	   The Bridge over the River Kwai was a best- selling novel and a highly successful film. But the bridge is also an actual construction, still in use today. 
 In the spring of 1942 the Japanese high command planned an extensive campaign in the Orient. Because the countries they planned to conquer were not accessible by road or water routes, the Japanese decided to link existing railroad lines together. One key link-then unbuilt-in the 264-mile project was a bridge over the Kwai, a minor river in Thailand. 
 The Japanese pressed 20,000 prisoners of war into a work force to build the railroad. After sixteen months of working under continuous bombardment by the Allied forces, the prisoners completed the line in November 1943 -at a cost of 16,000 lives. Some of the casualties were Japanese, but the bombing and tropical diseases killed mostly prisoners Englishmen, Dutchmen, Australians, Canadians, Indians, Malayans, New Zealanders. And the portion of the railway that took the greatest toll was the bridge on the River Kwai. 
 Today peace reigns on the banks of the river. But, like the Great Wall of China or the pyramids, the bridge is itself a monument to the many who died in its creation. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:34	1	2003-02-25 20:43:58
313	Silver	2c	7	8	   Of the significant events that have colored the pages of history, many have fallen on the same day of the week-Sunday. For example, Hitler and the Japanese chose that day to thrust the world into war. Peace was again shattered on a Sunday in 1950-the North Koreans crossed the 38th parallel to launch the Korean War.  
 Farther back on the pages of history, the battles of Lake Champlain and New Orleans-the key encounters in the War of 1812-occurred on Sundays; Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo on Sunday, June 18, 1815. Custer made his last stand at the Little Big Horn on a Sunday. And on a May Sunday in 1898 U.S. warships destroyed the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay.
 Peacetime did little to change Sunday's reputation as a day of important-and often tragic-news. The steamship Titanic sank during her maiden voyage on a Sunday in 1912. And on the same October Sunday in 1871, two of the greatest fires in U.S. history occurred. One ravaged Chicago while the other was sweeping through Peshtigo, Wisconsin, and the surrounding countryside. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:34	1	2003-02-13 18:41:06
314	Silver	2c	8	8	   Centuries ago in ancient Greece, formal education was for the very wealthy. Once, according to legend, a wise professor was approached by a group of noblemen who wished to honor their sons at a graduation banquet and wanted the professor to see that the students arrived in their finest clothing. 
 The following day the banquet hall was overflowing with noblemen dressed in dazzling jewels and expensive finery. Then came the great moment when the students entered with their professor; a startled cry arose from the crowd, for the students were not dressed in the garments of the noble. Each wore a sack- cloth robe and carried a mortarboard-the mark of a common workman. 
 The professor raised his hands for silence, explaining, &quot;Your sons are dressed in the clothing of the mason, for their destiny is to build. Some will build cities, and some will build lives. Perhaps one of them may even build an empire. But all will be builders on the solid foundation of knowledge.&quot; 
 However the tradition began, the cap and gown-the mortarboard and robe-have become an important part of graduation ceremonies, and the clothing of the ancient mason is the mark of today's scholar. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:35	1	2003-02-13 18:44:55
315	Silver	2c	9	8	   One of the greatest explosions of all time caused the destruction of Krakatoa, an island in the Sunda Straits between Java and Sumatra. On August 27, 1883, the active volcano MahaMeru erupted with such violence that almost the entire island disappeared. The island originally stood from 300 to 1400 feet above sea level; after two days of constant volcanic eruptions just a slim edge of the crater MahaMeru was left. 
 A column of stones, dust, white-hot lava, steam, molten rocks, ashes, snow, and ice shot up seventeen miles. The sky was so darkened by ashes that people in cities a hundred miles away had to keep lamps lighted for two days. The thunder of the explosion was heard in Australia-2250 miles away. Sound has never been known to travel such a great distance.
 The violent eruption caused an enormous tidal wave some hundred feet high. This wave swept first along the Sunda Straits, wiping out whole villages on the islands there and drowning more than 36,000 people. It traveled with great speed to the Indian Ocean, reached the southernmost tip of Africa, went around the Cape into the Atlantic and, thirty-two and a half hours later, reached the English Channel-11,040 miles away. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:35	1	2003-02-13 18:47:32
316	Silver	2c	10	8	   Many Indians of the southwestern United States lived, and some still live, in pueblos buildings made of straw, mud, and wood, and stacked one upon another. Some pueblos were built on level ground, while others were built in shallow caves in the sides of steep canyon walls, making what we call cliff dwellings. But whether the prehistoric Pueblo Indians lived on a plain or in a cliff dwelling, they were an unsanitary lot. They simply threw their garbage and other refuse into an unused room, tossed it out a door or window, or dropped it down the cliff. 
 Archaeologists have recently dug up a seventy-five-room cliff dwelling near the Arizona-Utah border. Between two rooms of the ruin-which they call Inscription House the digging crew found a pile of debris six feet deep. From this and similar garbage heaps the diggers recovered bushels of corncobs, fragments of squash rinds, nutshells, and thirty-three bodies, including one dog&quot;. 
 Inscription House was abandoned late in the thirteenth century. Where the Indians went is not known, but George J. Gumerman III, the excavation supervisor, speculated about why they left. &quot;Perhaps the smell drove them away,&quot; he said, not entirely in jest. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:35	1	2003-02-25 20:44:56
317	Silver	2c	11	8	Tutankhamen was an Egyptian pharaoh who died at eighteen after an unimportant life spent mostly in designing a gorgeous tomb for himself. Archaeologist Howard Carter hunted for this tomb in the Valley of the Kings for six years; he found the entrance to it just as he was about to give up. It took Carter two seasons to clear the antechamber alone of gilded furniture, statues and boxes, and the king's golden, jewel-inlaid throne.
 A stone casket in the inner chamber enclosed three coffins, one inside the other. The inner-most one, of solid gold, contained the king's body, which could hardly be seen because of the gold and jewels that covered it. A tiny wreath of withered flowers-perhaps the gift of the pharaoh's young queen-lay on the gold mask that covered the face.
 Modern archaeology succeeded where the ancient grave robbers failed, rescuing from the tomb the incredibly beautiful things that the world would otherwise never have seen. With patience and skill, Carter brought the treasures out whole and unscarred. Now, in the Cairo Museum, two men stand guard day and night, watching over King Tutankhamen's burial gifts, whose value is so great that it cannot be calculated.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:35	1	2007-06-29 17:15:40
318	Silver	2c	12	8	In south central Colorado there is an enormous expanse of sand dunes, some rising six hundred feet above the surrounding valley. In 1932 President Herbert Hoover proclaimed these fifty-seven square miles the Great Sand Dunes National Monument.
 Although an area of unrelieved desert, it supports an astonishing amount of wildlife. Rabbits, ground squirrels, chipmunks, skunks, coyotes, and 139 varieties of birds have been seen within its boundaries.
 Anyone who brings a pair of skis to the dunes can have a marvelous time, for their steep slopes are considered the equal of any ski run on snow. 
 Because the sky is usually cloudless, you'd expect the sand to be hot, but it's cool, probably because of the 8000-foot altitude.
 From a distance the sand looks tan. As you walk over it, however, you realize that it has tiny particles of many different colors-cream, umber, pink, blue, purple, and gray. The steadily moving sands require that the plants that grow there be somewhat elastic to keep from breaking when the dunes get higher.
 Although the area covers 36,740 acres, few sightseers wander very far, for in this miniature desert you could become as lost as you could in the famous Sahara.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:35	1	2003-02-25 20:45:46
319	Silver	2c	13	8	Today's road maps are perhaps the most valuable of the many items that are available free to Americans. They not only show almost every road from cinder byways to superexpressways, but give mileage and tolls, and locate capitals, campgrounds, golf courses, airports, museums, and football stadiums.
 Maps also serve purposes other than navigation. They're used as fans, picnic cloths, and flyswatters. Decorators convert them to wallpaper, lampshades, and book jackets.
 If you could halt one thousand vacationbound cars and examine the glove compartments, you might not find any gloves-but you would find several thousand maps. We can presume, too, that there are millions of maps in bookcases, basements, and attics. 
 William B. Akin, a Pittsburgh advertising executive who often got lost beyond city limits, conceived the idea of highway maps in 1914. They would be, he reasoned, more helpful than backseat drivers, and it would be nice if they were free. Alert ad man that he was, he tied his map idea to related products. A major oil company liked his idea, and the road-map industry was begun.
 Free road maps are an American institution. The service station that runs out of maps might soon run out of customers. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:36	1	2003-02-21 20:48:37
320	Silver	2c	14	8	At one time ships had to go around South America to get from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The distance by sea from New York to San Francisco was 13,135 miles. Now it's 5262 miles-thanks to the Panama Canal. In 1882 a French company began digging a canal across the Isthmus of Panama. The narrow strip of land was then a province of Colombia. Although the canal progressed rapidly, the French had to abandon construction when many workers died of yellow fever, smallpox, and malaria. Furthermore, the cost of construction mounted higher than they had estimated.
 The French offered to sell their property rights to the United States, but the Colombian government objected. In 1903 the people of Panama, knowing that a canal would give them trade advantages, declared themselves independent of Colombia and leased the Canal Zone-a strip of land ten miles wide-to the United States. U.S. Army officers were immediately given the task of cleaning up the zone to prevent the diseases that had been partly responsible for the French failure.
 The work was begun in 1904 and completed in 1914, and the trip from east coast to west was shortened by more than half. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:36	1	2003-02-25 20:47:36
321	Silver	2c	15	8	After the fall of Rome in A.D. 476, its territories were overrun by the wild tribes of northern and central Europe. This unsettled era, which lasted for about five hundred years, is known as the Dark Ages. The barbarians from the north had little interest in anything but looting and plundering.
 Very slowly, order was reestablished; a revival of learning was brought about. This was due to the priests of the Christian church who were interested in the writings of the Greeks and Romans, and to the survival of Roman law in the isolated communities of the fallen empire.
 The priests established schools for clergy and laymen. Students traveled for long distances to study under a famous teacher. As the reputation of a teacher spread through many countries, the number of his students grew. Other scholars, attracted by the large bodies of students, joined the first teacher in instructing them. From these groups of students gathered round several teachers, the idea of the university arose.
 Later, to protect their teachers and students from interference or persecution, the schools sought charters of rights and privileges from the pope or kings. These charters marked the beginnings of the university in Western Europe.  		1	2002-11-06 08:36:36	1	2003-02-21 22:31:13
322	Tan	2c	2	3	   Some birds sew their homes. They use two leaves for cloth and a spider web for thread. With their bills, they poke holes along the leaf edges. One bird pushes the web through a hole.
The other catches it and pokes it through the next hole. When the leaves form a deep pocket, the birds fill it with grass and moss. They check their work often and sew up weak spots. These clever birds are called tailorbirds.

 During the winter the squirrel gets hungry. He roams the woods. He has a keen sense of smell that helps him find many of his nuts. Sometimes he can find them under a foot of snow. Some that he doesn't find sprout in the spring. They become trees. These trees fill the countryside. That makes the squirrel a great helper.

   Thinking fast, the hunter shut the door from the outside, shouting, &quot;There's the first one, boys. You skin him. I'll go get another.&quot; 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:41	1	2003-02-22 11:05:26
349	Blue	3a	14	4	   Africa is the homeland of buff-backed herons. There they follow grazing animals. They eat frogs and grasshoppers disturbed by the grazers. Often a heron perches on a grazer's back to feed on ticks.
   In 1930 some herons moved to South America. There they followed cattle. They did not eat the same food as the native cow- birds. So newcomers and natives did not quarrel.
   Now these &quot;cattle egrets&quot; are known in North America. In farming country they have found a new way to get food. They follow a farmer at work. As the soil is turned up, they eat the exposed insects and worms. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:41	1	2003-02-22 11:07:33
350	Blue	3a	15	4	   Dr. Albert Einstein's neighbor was worried. Every day her small daughter went to call on the great scientist. At last the mother went to Einstein. She told him she was sorry if the girl was keeping him from his work.
   &quot;Oh, not at all,&quot; Einstein told her. &quot;I like her to come to see me. We get along quite well.&quot;
   &quot;But what could you and an eight-year-old girl have in common?&quot; asked the mother.
   &quot;A great deal,&quot; said the scientist. &quot;I love the jelly beans she brings me. And she loves the way I do her arithmetic lessons.&quot; 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:41	1	2003-02-22 11:08:53
351	Brown	3a	6	8	   As early as the fourth century B.C., wooden legs were used as substitutes for legs lost in accidents or battles. Wood was replaced by iron or steel in later years, and by the sixteenth century the making of metal limbs had become an art. The metalsmiths who fashioned swords and armor also hammered out complicated arms, legs, and hands for crippled warriors.
   We know of many of these devices from the books of Ambroise Pare, a French surgeon, who began his career as a barber's apprentice. In his time surgery was still being performed mostly by barber-surgeons and, like his colleagues. Pare practiced on many battlefields.
   The usual treatment of a shattered limb was amputation followed by plunging the stump in boiling oil. This was horribly painful for the victim, and often fatal. Pare stopped the use of boiling oil and revived the practice of tying off the blood vessels. On August 24, 1572, when Paris was the scene of a great massacre in which ten thousand French Protestants were killed by order of King Charles IX, Pare was spared because of his reputation as a great surgeon. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:41	1	2003-02-25 20:48:34
352	Brown	3a	7	8	   As anyone who repeats the &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; rhyme knows, an old remedy for headache is brown paper soaked with vinegar. This practice is still followed in parts of North America and England.
   Here are more folk remedies for headaches-some work, some don't. Camomile tea is a European remedy. A pillow stuffed with camomile flowers is another cure. Koreans boil chrysanthemum roots to drink. Drinking elder-tree tea is still a widespread American practice.
   In Africa, some tribes fix a copper wire around the head, believing the pain will move from the head to the wire. The inside bark of a fir tree made into a poultice was once used by North American Chippewa Indians; other tribes bound mustard leaves to the forehead. The Negro practice of rubbing horseradish on the area of pain really seems to give relief. The Ayrnara Indians of South America eat starfish to cure headaches or else wear a live dragonfly under their hats.
   Running bareheaded in the rain on May Day is an old charm against having headaches for a year, but an amethyst ring is even better: its wearer is supposed never to suffer from headaches. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:41	1	2003-02-22 11:14:06
353	Brown	3a	8	8	   Our chief source of fresh water is the rainfall that collects in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. Recently, however, we have discovered a new source, aquifers, which are rock formations containing water. Even under deserts, vast aquifers may be waiting to be tapped. Companies drilling for oil in the Middle East have sometimes struck aquifers, which provide unexpected water supplies for arid regions.
   Aquifers contain water that has seeped down through the earth and slowly accumulated, over decades or even centuries. They are deeper than ordinary wells and usually do not contain pools of water. Aquifers are more like sponges. The water is suspended in a porous rock. such as sandstone, in a mixture of loose sand and gravel, or in fractured rocks. Often an aquifer is the source of an underground river.
   It is usually far cheaper to drill a pipeline to an aquifer than to build a reservoir for holding surface water. Another advantage of aquifers is that the sun cannot evaporate their water. But water should not be withdrawn from an aquifer faster than it accumulates. If it is, the aquifer may run dry. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:42	1	2003-02-22 11:17:08
354	Brown	3a	9	8	   Black is the color of mourning. Red symbolizes danger, violence, or bloodshed. If you're afraid, you're yellow. None of these sayings is true outside the English-speaking world. In China and Korea white is the color of mourning. In Russia red stands for beauty and life. In Italy and Germany you're yellow with anger, not with fear.
   It is not necessary to leave our own language area to find color contradictions. A redcap in the United States is a porter in a station; in Britain a redcap is a military policeman. Both names are logical, because both men wear red caps. Likewise, the British equivalent of an American white-collar worker is sometimes called a black-coated worker.
   We needn't even cross an ocean to have logical color distinctions. Would you rather be red-blooded or a blueblood? The first is literal, and so is the second if we trace its origin. The expression, which is now international, comes from Spain, where some noble Castilian families asserted they had <i>sangre azul</i>, meaning that they had no Moorish or Jewish blood. But why &quot;blue&quot; blood? Because the veins stand out when their possessor is fair-skinned. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:42	1	2003-02-25 20:49:16
355	Brown	3a	10	8	   A tsunami is a great wave or series of waves. It extends from the surface water to the sea floor and moves the entire vertical section of ocean through which it speeds. The greater the ocean depth, the faster the tsunami travels. Speeds of up to 600 mph have been recorded. Toward land it slows down as the bottom of the wave drags on the seabed; its crest rises from fifty to a hundred feet or more. 
   A tsunami, generated by the eruption of the volcano Krakatau, killed 36,000 people in Java and Sumatra in 1883. Twenty-seven thousand people who had gathered for a festival on the coast of Japan one June evening in 1896 died in another tsunami. Earthquakes in Chile in 1960 generated a tsunami that traveled over 12,000 miles, bringing death and destruction as it broke against Hawaii, Japan, and other islands in its surge westward across the Pacific Ocean.
   Scientists now have an effective system for locating a tsunami at its source. They can calculate when it will arrive at points of land and can warn people to move to higher areas. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:42	1	2003-02-22 11:29:35
356	Brown	3a	11	8	   When Mrs. Joseph Groeger died recently in Vienna, Austria, people asked the obvious, &quot;Why did she live to be 107?&quot; Tentative answers were provided by a survey conducted among 148 Viennese men and women who had reached the age of 100. Somewhat surprising was the fact that the majority had lived most of their lives in cities. In spite of the city's image as an unhealthy place, city living often provides benefits that country living can lack. One factor seems to be important to the longevity of those interviewed.
   This factor is exercise. In the cities it is often faster and less frustrating to walk short distances than to wait for a bus. Even taking public transportation often requires some walking. Smaller apartment houses have no elevators' and so tenants must climb stairs. City dwellers can usually walk to local supermarkets. Since parking spaces are hard to find, there is often no alternative to walking.
   On the other hand, those who live in the country and suburbs do not have to walk every day. In fact, the opposite is often true. To go to school, work, or almost anywhere else, they must ride in cars. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:42	1	2003-02-25 20:51:08
357	Brown	3a	12	8	   Ancient man attempted to change the weather by using magic. When experience taught him this was impossible, he tried to forecast weather conditions. Even earlier than 1000 B.C. there were weather seers in Babylon-and priests clever enough to denounce as frauds those who predicted the weather a year in advance.
   Some forecasters used methods that seem to have no connection with the actual factors controlling the weather. Chickens and other animals were sacrificed and their intestines poked to find signs indicating rain or drought.
   Somewhat more scientific were predictions based on vegetation: &quot;Onion's skin very thin, mild winter coming in. Onion's skin thick and tough, coming winter cold and rough.&quot;
   Insects and animals were also favorite weather clues: &quot;When the glowworm lights his lamp, then the air is always damp.&quot; &quot;If spiders their cobwebs forsake, the weather will for certain break.&quot; If frogs remained in pools, the weather would be fine. If they were seen on rocks, rain and cold were due. It's difficult to say whether this rhyme should be taken seriously: &quot;Hark, I hear the asses bray. Methinks we'll have some rain today.&quot; 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:42	1	2003-02-22 11:42:03
358	Brown	3a	13	8	   People often dream of living in a perfect place where no one would be poor, no one would be rich, and everyone would be considerate of everyone else. Such a place, however, is too good to be true: such a place is nowhere, and that's what the word <i>Utopia</i> means. It is made up of two Greek words meaning <i>not a place</i>.
   The word was first used by Sir Thomas More, a sixteenth century English writer whose book <i>Utopia</i>, published in 1516, described a perfect island country. More's idea for his tale came from the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. Plato's <i>The Republic</i> described what would be a perfect state.
   Early legends among the Norse, Celtic, and Arab peoples told of a perfect place existing somewhere in the Atlantic. These legends were no longer believed when explorations of the Americas began, but after More's time it became common for writers to imagine and describe perfect places. 
   Today when people want certain changes in government or society, their ideas are sometimes labeled <i>Utopian</i>. Usually the critics mean that the changes, if effected, would not suddenly make everything perfect because people are by nature imperfect. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:43	1	2003-02-22 11:48:13
359	Brown	3a	14	8	   Helena Rubinstein was one of the world's ten richest self-made women. She once boasted, &quot;I could have made a fortune selling paper clips.&quot; As it was, she made her fortune selling cosmetics, beginning with a dozen jars of face cream made from an old Polish recipe of her mother's, and ending with a worldwide business worth millions. 
   Madame, as her staff called her, lived a life full of contradictions. She kept her dazzling collection of jewels under her bed in a worn box of old clothes until someone bought her a steel cabinet to file them in - diamonds under D, rubies under R. and so forth. She carried her lunch to work in a paper bag, which usually contained a jumble of chicken, salad, and loose paper money.
   Despite her wealth, Madame Rubinstein had a mania for saving money. French President Georges Pompidou once rented a Paris apartment from her. She noticed that he left the building at exactly 8:50 every morning. Madame began ordering her daily taxi for 8:45 so that she could save on cab fare by following Pompidou's motorcycle escort through the heavy Paris traffic. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:43	1	2008-01-04 19:03:39
360	Brown	3a	15	8	   Giant sloths, which appeared millions of years ago, have gone. The equally ancient tree-dwelling sloths remain. They are upsidedown inhabitants of the jungle. Except when climbing, they cling to the undersides of branches.
   Slow-moving, practically toothless, no larger than a fair-sized dog, the sloth cannot defend itself. Its claws, though sharp, are needed for clinging. 
   One factor protecting the sloth is its natural camouflage. Millions of extremely simple plants called pleurococci grow in tiny grooves in the sloth's fur and give it the color of the moss on the trees. Asleep or moving, the greenish-hued sloth is hardly visible in its treetop home. 
   Living upside down gives another advantage: the sloth is not easily attacked, especially when clinging near the end of a branch. Its chief enemy, the jaguar, cannot reach it. 
   The sloth's toughness also aids its survival. The more advanced an animal's brain is, the more easily the animal dies when wounded. Tiny-brained, sloths hardly seem to feel pain, and survive even when badly clawed by a jaguar or an eagle.
   These sluggish tree dwellers have achieved something that their monstrous cousins of the past failed to do. They have endured. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:43	1	2003-02-22 11:57:10
361	Gold	3a	6	7.5	   For Earth Week in April 1971, officials of the Bronx Zoo in New York arranged an unusual exhibit - a graveyard. Each headstone bore the name of a land animal that man has caused to become extinct. Though the exhibit covered only the years since 1600, there were 225 headstones. Man's victims include the Cape lion, the great auk, and the passenger pigeon.
   A notice posted at the edge of the graveyard explained what it represented. The second paragraph made the meaning clear.
   &quot;In the past, miners carried canaries with them into a mine. If the canaries died, the men knew the mine contained poisonous gas. Today many species of wild animals are on the verge of dying out, thus warning that the earth is becoming unsuitable for life. If we can save other species from becoming extinct, we might also save ourselves.&quot;
   Near the headstone marked <i>Choiseul Crested Pigeon</i> was placed a headstone lettered <i> Man</i> . Above the word was carved a large question mark.

362	Gold	3a	7	7.5	   Until recently, a smudge pot with heavy oil burning in it has been one of the few weapons a farmer could use to save his crops from frost. A canopy over plants also reduces heat loss, but canopies can't cover fields. Some farmers use smoke screens, but they make the leaves sooty and the smoke usually wafts onto the next farm. Large rotating fans above trees are used in orchards. The idea behind the fans is to create turbulence so that the frosty air cannot settle near the ground.
   Now, researchers in Canada have made a product that looks stranger than any of these, but it works. When frost is forecast, a farmer jumps on his tractor and zips up and down his rows of strawberries, tomatoes, tobacco, or small fruit trees, spraying a protein foam that is up to four feet wide and three inches thick. The foam is so soft and light that not a stem or leaf is damaged. The air trapped in the bubbles insulates plants against the cold. In about eighteen hours the foam breaks down and scatters. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:44	1	2003-02-22 12:05:20
363	Gold	3a	8	7.5	   The trick in food photography is to show the food looking fresh, so many dishes have stand-ins, just as movie stars do. &quot;When I get my lights and camera set up, I remove the stand-in and put in the real thing,&quot; explains Ray Webber, who photographs food for magazine advertisements. &quot;Sometimes I have to brush the pleat with its juices because it may have dried out a bit. And when I'm shooting something like tomatoes, I always carry an atomizer of water to spray them with dew just before I shoot.&quot;
   Shooting food outdoors has special problems. &quot;I'm always worrying about flies or slugs crawling up a glass,&quot; Webber explains. &quot;My pet worry is that someday a dog will come up from behind and run off with the food.&quot; Once Webber was shooting a piece of cheese outdoors and needed something to complement its color. Finally he found it: a weed with lovely blue flowers. When the shot appeared, several people were horrified-the weed was deadly nightshade! 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:44	1	2003-02-22 12:07:21
364	Gold	3a	9	7.5	   In Melbourne, Australia, not long ago specialists gave advice on a patient's problem. There's nothing unusual in that-except that the patient was in the far west of New South Wales at the time. That's hundreds of miles from Melbourne. The heart disease experts were able to make their diagnosis after listening to the patient's heartbeat over the telephone.
   They were testing a new device that can change readings of a patient's heartbeat into tone signals that can be sent by telephone. The device was designed in Australia. It is meant for use in areas far from large cities. Doctors in remote areas can take the heartbeat readings right in the patient's home. Then they can play them over a telephone line to specialists in larger centers. The doctor in the remote area is thus able to obtain an expert's opinion on the heart condition of his patient. Experiments with the device show that the whole process takes only a few minutes. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:44	1	2003-02-25 20:54:28
365	Gold	3a	10	7.5	   The most devoted falconer of his time was Frederick II, Holy Roman emperor and king of Sicily and Jerusalem. He was a remarkable man. An able ruler and soldier, he was also a noted scholar and poet. As an artist he was skillful enough to illustrate his manuscript for <i>On the Art of Hunting with Birds</i>. He maintained farms to improve livestock and plants. No wonder men of his day called him <i>Stupor Mundi</i>, &quot;Amazement of the World.&quot;
   Falconry was Frederick's refuge from the cares of state. But it was more than a lifelong hobby: it was a passion. Once he even lost a critical battle because he had gone &quot;hunting with birds.&quot; Though his home castle was noted for its splendor, at his stone-built hunting lodges he lived simply. His main relaxation was his falcons and falconers, assembled from many lands.
   Throughout his life Frederick kept notes on his beloved art. During his last years he spent time on his manuscript. The work, unfinished when he died in 1250, was completed by his son. It is still consulted by experts. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:44	1	2003-02-22 12:14:51
366	Gold	3a	11	7.5	   The Japanese have an unusual method for catching ayu - small, troutlike freshwater fish. They use birds called cormorants. The best-known area for cormorant fishing is at Gifu, on the Nagara River. During the six months of May through October, fishing takes place nightly, except when the moon is full.
   Each torchlit boat is manned by four men - a chief, his assistant, and two rowers. All are dressed in the traditional costume of black shirt, grass skirt, and cone-shaped bamboo hat. At the bow the chief controls twelve cormorants, which are tethered to his fingers by cords attached to neck rings that keep the birds from swallowing any fish they catch. The assistant controls fewer birds. As the boat travels downstream, the chief and his assistant release the birds into the water, skillfully keeping the cords from becoming tangled. At intervals the birds are returned to regurgitate their catches, but they are allowed to swallow some of the fish as payment for their work. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:44	1	2003-02-22 12:18:49
367	Gold	3a	12	7.5	   The horse has been man's friend since earliest times, as paintings on the walls of old caves and tombs show. A man on his steed became a symbol of power, striking fear into those he had conquered. A knight of medieval times would own several horses - one for war, some for racing and hunting, and others for jousting - while his lady had a palfrey of her own.
   Later the horse played an important role in the field of medicine. Horsehair was used as thread to sew up wounds. The blood of horses was useful in the development of serums. In 1895 Emil von Behring developed a diphtheria serum. He injected into horses increasing doses of toxins until their blood built up a resistance. The serum he obtained from the horses' blood helped cure diphtheria in human beings. The same method was used to develop a serum for tetanus, commonly known as lockjaw. 
   Today horseflesh is eaten by people in some parts of Europe and Asia. In many other countries horseflesh serves mainly as cat and dog food. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:45	1	2003-02-22 12:21:17
368	Gold	3a	13	7.5	   In the future, we may herd enormous schools of fish as livestock are herded on grasslands. Scuba divers assisted by dolphins may be the herders of these watery ranges. Experiments with fencing are already being carried out. Pipes laid on the ocean floor send up fountains of air bubbles, which frighten Fish away. Air-bubble and other fencing will aid the herders.
   Herding will supply much more seafood than trawlers do by casting nets. A similar comparison is that herding cattle provides much more meat than hunting could provide. It was an important step toward civilization when roving tribes of hunters became herdsmen. They then kept their meat alive in nearby pastures instead of searching for it.
   Aquanauts herding fish will have all the advantages of the cattle raiser. Besides being able to corral their livestock, they will be able to breed strains that produce the most and best seafood. They will be able to inoculate their fish or treat them for diseases. They may even brand fish, perhaps by some laser device that marks them as they swim past. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:45	1	2003-02-22 12:27:21
369	Gold	3a	14	7.5	   The cat has greater endurance and stamina than other animals of similar size. Although its bones are light and small, the cat is rugged and solidly put together. It has about 230 bones and more than 500 voluntary muscles. Its spine is flexible, with 48 vertebrae, including the tail, which has between 18 and 21 vertebrae. It can leap several times its body length - up and forward at the same time.
   If a car dealer were selling cats, he would be sure to cite the equipment included in the model: retractable claws; about thirty whiskers that help the animal sense its surroundings in the dark; thirty teeth; eyes with protective membranes and expanding vertical pupils that let it see in near darkness; and a raspy tongue for self-grooming.
   A cat can quickly get itself out of trouble. Sometimes it resorts to psychological warfare: hissing, snarling, arching its back, and bristling its hair until it looks twice its size. A cat's ability to emerge triumphant accounts for its mythical nine lives. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:45	1	2003-02-25 21:57:42
370	Gold	3a	15	7.5	   Twins occur about once in eighty-seven human births. A little more than one-quarter of these are identical twins, which develop from the equal division of a fertilized egg. Identical twins are always the same sex and have the same blood group and eye color. If one has a gift for music, it is not surprising if the other does too. However, if one is left-handed, the other may be right-handed. If the hair of one grows clockwise from the crown, the other's hair may grow counterclockwise. 
   Fraternal twins develop from two separate eggs that are fertilized at the same time. They can be of different sexes and often look no more alike than other members of the same family.
   The more babies per birth, the less frequently such births occur. Triplets occur about once in 7569 births, but sextuplets - multiple births of six - occur once in about Five million births. Multiple births are common among lower animals, but identical offspring are rare, except for one species of armadillo. The female armadillo always gives birth to quadruplets. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:45	1	2003-02-25 20:56:17
371	Green	3a	6	11	David Thomson is an electronics technician, trained by the U.s. Navy, who writes instruction books for complicated equipment. He is convinced that every person is surrounded by a force field that can broadcast emotions to other human beings. The ability to receive such force fields, Thomson believes, explains how one can sense another's fear, nervousness, aggression, panic, or friendliness.
   This theory of emotional communication occurred to Thomson when he told a psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Ward, that he was certain his own hypertension made those near him uncomfortable. To demonstrate the theory, Thomson constructed a transmitter capable of generating an electromagnetic field similar to that of a man beset by hyperanxiety. For a year, with this in his pocket, Thomson made people miserable. He would find a hungry man delightedly preparing to eat a steak in a restaurant, turn on the transmitter, and watch as the man became tense and irritable and finally left with his steak uneaten. In another test, Thomson cleared a crowded room in fifteen minutes. Such an exodus could not be due, Thomson observed, to personality problems alone.
   Dr. Ward, who had become Thomson's partner, insisted that there was already misery enough in the world. Thomson fashioned a &quot;happiness transmitter ,&quot; which can duplicate the force field of a contented man. University psychologists in the United States report some encouraging results in current tests of the Thomson-and-Ward transmitter.
   The &quot;happiness machine&quot; has many possibilities. Thomson has speculated on its use near disturbed or anxious patients in hospitals, and in unruly crowds. Tranquility, like panic and violence, may be contagious.

372	Green	3a	7	11	   Sir Alister Hardy, a British scientist, predicts that we may soon look to the oceans for badly needed living space. Just as other land mammals returned lo the sea to escape the rigors and shortages of life on land, so man may return to the oceans as a semi-aquatic being.
   Hardy supports his prediction with an astonishing theory: that man at one time <i>did</i> partially revert to the oceans and that this explains the missing link between man and the apes. During the period when this connecting link might have left its skeleton on land, man was in the shallows of the seas. He learned to walk upright (as no other primates do) in lhe buoyancy of water; he developed the ability to maneuver in water. He was on the verge of becoming a sea mammal. Then - having learned to walk upright - man returned to land. 
   While Hardy does not suggest that we abandon the land altogether, he believes that much of our population will become underwater artisans, ranching and farming on the continental shelves, moving about easily and quickly will) greatly improved aqualung equipment and &quot;underwater scooterlike devices.&quot; 
   He is generally supported by Jacques-Yves Cousteau, French pioneer in underwater exploration. Cousteau predicts a whole new race of man, which he calls <i>Homo aquaticus</i>. dwelling on land and in the sea. Created partly by surgery and medical discoveries that will solve the problems of breathing and surviving pressure changes from sea bottom to surface. <i>Homo aquaticus</i> will adapt by evolution to his double-role existence. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:46	1	2003-02-25 21:10:30
373	Green	3a	8	11	   Since 1965, when its equipment became operational, a device called Eros has been helping to make sky traffic safe. <i>Eros</i> is short for Eliminate Range Zero System - range zero meaning collision.
   Basically Eros is a computer system that measures, with great speed and precision, closing speed (the speed at which two objects are approaching each other) and range (the distance apart of the objects). Eros can warn aircraft approaching each other at jet speeds and can provide protection for as many as a thousand aircraft in a wide area. The pilot of an Eros-equipped aircraft heading for a collision hears a warning noise in his earphones when his airborne computer calculates that he is within thirty seconds or half a mile (whichever occurs first) of another aircraft. At the same time, a flashing red arrow on the device's indicator panel instructs him to descend. Simultaneously, in the other aircraft, the signal is automatically reversed: the flashing arrow tells the pilot to climb.
   The newer Eros II system can accommodate a total of two thousand aircraft at one time within a 140-mile radius. Every three seconds, each Eros-equipped plane automatically reports to ground stations and to similarly equipped aircraft its precise range, altitude, and approach rate.
   The producers of Eros, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation in the United States, are now studying the fitting of Eros collision-avoidance systems in all sizes and types of aircraft. Automatic systems such as Eros will do more than make the sky safer: they will also lighten the work of air-traffic controllers and increase the efficiency of airports. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:46	1	2003-02-25 21:11:55
374	Green	3a	9	11	   The term acronym comes from two Creek words: acros meaning &quot;tip&quot; and onoma meaning &quot;name.&quot; Acronyms are words formed by using the beginning letters or syllables of other words. 
   Although the term was not coined until 1943, acronyms were used long before. In ancient Rome the army's banners carried the acronym SPQR, which (translated from Latin) stood for the Senate and People of Rome. Since then the acronym has flourished, until today there are more than 80,000 English-language acronyms alone.
   The acronym has proliferated particularly in the scientific and technical Fields. Advances in electronic and space research have produced new concepts and devices that can be easily identified by abbreviating their lengthy descriptive names. Two of the most commonly used are radar (<i>r</i>adio <i>d</i>etection and <i>r</i>anging) and laser light <i>a</i>mplification by <i>s</i>timulated <i>e</i>mission of <i>r</i>adiation). Interestingly enough, <i>laser</i> is applicable in both English-speaking and French-speaking countries, for the beginning letters of the words used to describe this device are the same in both languages. 
   Acronyms are popular because they are often easier to remember and say than complicated names, and so communication of ideas is facilitated. Sometimes, however, using acronyms encourages confusion rather than clarity. During the American <i>Apollo 12</i> flight, a minor malfunction in the spacecraft was found to be caused by the digital uplift assembly. When Mission Control radioed that the DUA was responsible, the astronauts inquired: &quot;What is a DUA?&quot; 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:46	1	2003-02-25 21:13:45
375	Green	3a	10	11	   Long ago churches were built in such a way that echoes were removed through holes in the walls. Every hole was the mouth of a juglike receptacle hidden within the wall. Every jug was by nature tuned to a characteristic wavelength of sound and would, if left empty, spontaneously emit that sound in the presence of an identical sound. But if a certain amount of ashes was poured into the jug, the ash would absorb reverberations at the jug's characteristic frequency and convert the energy of the sound waves into heat, which would quickly dissipate within the walls.
   Architectural refinements obviously inspired by the medieval &quot;sound pots&quot; can be seen in many places today. Instead of individual jugs in the walls, concert halls and theaters have panels of hardwood screen. Sound enters the holes in the screen and spreads out in the space behind. The space is Filled with blankets of rock wool, which replicate the silencing effect of the ancient jugs. Another sound-swallowing technique employs vertical wooden slats several inches apart. Reverberations enter the spaces between the slats and again encounter rock-wool mufflers.
   Aircraft designers have come to appreciate the potential of sound pots. The DC-IO, First flying in 1971, was quieter than its immediate ancestors. The inner surfaces of the engine nacelles, the enclosed parts in which the jet airliner's engines ride, are perforated with hundreds of holes much smaller than the apertures in the church wall. Hidden behind these punctures, in a glass-fibered labyrinth sandwiched between metal sheets, are infinite miniature replicas of the ancient sound- swallowing jugs. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:46	1	2003-02-24 13:53:43
376	Green	3a	11	11	   The mystery had now reached its climax: the man had undoubtedly been murdered, and it was absolutely certain no one could conceivably have done it. It was therefore time to call in the great detective, who gave one searching glance at the corpse, then produced a microscope.
   &quot;Aha!&quot; he exclaimed as he picked a hair off the lapel of the dead man's coal. &quot;The mystery is a mystery no longer. We have only to Find the man who lost this hair, and the criminal will be in our hands.&quot; The inexorable chain of logic was complete, and the detective embarked on his search.
   For four days and four nights he moved unobserved through the streets of New York, scanning closely every face he passed, looking for a man who had lost a hair. On the fifth day he discovered a man disguised as a tourist, his head enveloped in a cap reaching below his ears. The man was about to board the <i>Glorilania</i>. and the detective lost no time in following him on board.
   &quot;Arrest him!&quot; shouted the detective, and then, drawing himself to his full height, he brandished aloft the hair. &quot;This is his,&quot; said the great detective, &quot;and it proves his guilt.&quot;
   &quot;Remove his hat,&quot; ordered the ship's captain sternly.
   It was discovered that the man was entirely bald.
   &quot;Aha!&quot; exclaimed the great detective without a moment's hesitation. &quot;He has committed not one murder, but about one million!&quot; 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:46	1	2003-06-27 13:19:56
377	Green	3a	12	11	   There are three fundamental human body types - endomorphic, mesomorphic, and ectomorphic. The extreme endomorph combines heavy fat distributiun and lack of bony angularity with a round face, short neck, wide hips, and heavy limbs. The extreme mesomorph has a solid, muscular, big- boned physique, with a large chest, slender waist, long torso, and relatively short, powerful arms and legs. Extreme ectomorphs are characterized by their slender bodies, short trunks, long arms and legs, long narrow hands and feet, and lack of fat.
   In reality there are few extreme endomorphs, mesomorphs, or ectomorphs; most individuals exhibit some of the characteristics of each body type. However, most do tend toward one of the three classifications.
   Consideration of your general body type can help guide you into sports in which you will be likely to succeed, and away from those that may be frustrating or in which the risk of injury is great. If you tend to be heavy and rounded (endomorphic), you should choose activities that don't demand great support of the body weight during fast movement. Swimming, golf, archery, bowling, hunting. Fishing, and canoeing are all good choices. If you have a number of mesomorphic characteristics, you can expect reasonable success in almost any sport and will probably especially enjoy football, soccer, wrestling, and other highly vigorous sports. If you are the slender type (ectomorphic), your best sports will be those that take advantage of your ability to support your weight efficiently during quick moves and abrupt stops. Such sports include track, tennis, badminton, and basketball. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:47	1	2003-02-25 21:19:14
378	Green	3a	13	11	   On a June day in 1969, ham radio operators who happened lo have their receivers turned to 14324 kilohertz heard this message: &quot;This is L12B. We are approximately 920 miles from the nearest island in the Lesser Antilles and about 2400 miles from Morocco. The papyrus raft <i>Ra 2</i> came through enormous seas undamaged, but we are drifting sideways helplessly. . . .&quot; The listening hams who checked the call letters and discovered that LI designates a Norwegian ham station began to wonder how a Norwegian radio amateur could possibly be drifting 920 miles from the Lesser Antilles.
   L12B was the call assigned to the ham station aboard Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl's reed raft, the hams on board were taking part in Heyerdahl's historic attempt to prove that Central and South America could have been settled by Africans sailing across the Atlantic on tiny reed rafts, rather than by Asians coming down from Russia via Alaska, as most anthropologists believe. Heyerdahl set out to make the journey himself on a raft similar to those African explorers might have used hundreds or even thousands of years before Columbus. His only concession to the twentieth century on <i>Ra 2</i> was ham radio.
   Before his departure Heyerdahl had arranged for a network of ham radio operators to report on his progress and to alert rescuers if the need arose. For the hams who participated in the project, as well as for those who just eavesdropped, the broadcasts from the Heyerdahl expedition proved to be exciting listening. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:47	1	2003-02-25 21:20:26
379	Green	3a	14	11	   So far, astronauts have had plenty to do during their voyages. In addition, their minds were stimulated by their view of Earth and by continuous radio contact with ground stations. But there may be psychological problems in a long space voyage, with no change of scene, no contact with Earth, few sensations in a relatively weightless body, and little activity. This situation could cause symptoms of <i>sensory deprivation</i>. 
   In one attempt to duplicate the numbing effects of prolonged weightlessness, three men were strapped to a board suspended so that it would remain level. After slightly over three weeks, their bodies began to ache. One man lost all sense of lime and space and had to be released. After another week, however, the remaining two began to feel comfortable.
   Other experiments in sensory deprivation have been carried out by putting men on a soft bed in a dark, soundproof room and covering all exposed skin surfaces. The men could see, hear, and feel nothing. Most found this experience intolerable after only a few days. Some even suffered from hallucinations - seeing imaginary sights, hearing imaginary sounds.
   These experiments have revealed much about the nature of consciousness. The human mind can't operate normally unless it receives a constant succession of stimuli to work on. If it cannot be fed with stimuli, it invents imaginary ones.
   Like other research undertaken in aerospace laboratories, these experiments may prove helpful for people who never leave Earth. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:48	1	2003-02-24 14:55:08
380	Green	3a	15	11	    The story of the Plimsoll mark is an exciting chapter in the history of British navigation. In 1870 Samuel Plimsoll, a Member of Parliament, became interested in seamen's safety . At that time there were no inspections for seaworthiness, and ships often went lo sea with leaky bottoms, rotten spars, worn-out rigging, and boilers covered with rust. Worse, shipowners greedy for quick profits would order their vessels loaded with cargoes so heavy 'that the upper decks were forced down to the water's edge. When such a ship encountered heavy seas, only a miracle could save it.
   Plimsoll began his crusade against these deplorable practices by presenting in Parliament a bill requiring shipowners to mark their ships with a safety-load line. The measure was defeated. Undaunted, he introduced the bill repeatedly, only lo have it rejected every time.
   At last, however, popular feeling was aroused, and in 1876 the Board of Trade was authorized to inspect all outward-bound ships. Of the 286 checked during the following nine months, 256 were declared unfit for ocean travel, and one of every ten was so dangerously overloaded that it was practically sinking at the wharfside. 
   Finally, in 1890, Parliament ruled that a Plimsoll mark be painted on every British ship. The mark, a circular disk 12 inches in diameter with an 18-inch-long horizontal bar drawn through its center, indicated the depth to which a vessel could be safely loaded. Today every ship carries this symbol - a tribute to Samuel Plimsoll's concern and perseverance. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:48	1	2003-02-25 21:21:27
381	Lime	3a	6	10	   The dog has always been considered man's best friend. Always noted for being particularly faithful in watching over children, he also has his place by the Fireside, in the cow pasture, on the sheep range, and beside the hunter in forest or blind. He is easy to train, works hard, and often performs astonishing feats. And in the frozen polar regions he was once the principal motive power, before being largely displaced by the plane and helicopter.
   Because he howls or whines in the presence of impending death, the dog was once thought to have supernatural powers and believed to be capable of seeing gods and ghosts invisible to men. Actually, the basis for these beliefs lies in the hound's sensitivity to people's feelings and his superior hearing ability and sense of smell, which enable him to detect signs hidden from human observation. His record of saving lives is outstanding, for he often gives warning of fire and other dangers not noticed by his master.
   The dog's major contribution, however, has been to medical research. Both his diet and his structure are comparable to those of the human being, and so he has been the subject of countless demonstrations  and experiments. Open-heart surgery has been made possible largely because of the dog. But his sacrifice has repaid his own species as well by safeguarding it from rabies, distemper, and other diseases. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:49	1	2003-02-24 15:02:23
382	Lime	3a	7	10	   Each of the magnetic termitariums in northern Australia is home for some two million termites. The &quot;skyscrapers,&quot; built of wood particles cemented together, are literally thousands of termite stories high. Inside each structure, which may rise as high as twenty feet, is a maze of chambers and passages.
   The termites practice a rigid caste system. Each caste - rulers, soldiers, and workers - has specific duties. The wingless king and queen do nothing but eat and reproduce, the latter being their sole prerogative. The soldiers' duties are restricted to guarding their monarchs and defending the colony. All other tasks are left to the workers. They build and repair the termitarium, gather food and store it in special chambers, feed both the young and adults of the other castes, carry off waste mutter, and lay the dead at rest in galleries especially reserved for the purpose.
   But the truly amazing thing about these creatures is the position of their tombstonelike homes. The termitariums always point roughly north and south. The term roughly is important, for these carefully constructed buildings are not aligned with true north but with magnetic north, which varies two, three, or even five degrees from true north. Where the magnetic variation differs, so does the bearing of the termitarium. How termites can tell magnetic from true north, and what function the north-south orientation may have, remain mysteries. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:49	1	2003-02-25 21:22:57
383	Lime	3a	8	10	   A common desert phenomenon is the mirage, an optical illusion caused when light waves are bent or refracted by layers of air that are different in density. A ray of light conies from a point above the horizon and passes on a slanting angle through a layer of cooler and heavier air. When this ray strikes the layer of hot, less dense air that hangs in an eddy above the sand or pavement, the beam is bent upward. Often this refraction of light produces an illusion that looks and shimmers like a lake of actual water. Frequently the mirage effect turns a range of distant mountain peaks into islands rising from glittering blue water or into castle turrets.
   Mirages in the four linked Australian deserts - Great Sandy, Simpson, Great Victoria, and Gibson - are unusually realistic. Ordinarily the person seeing the mirage reports that he sees a palm-fringed lagoon or a blue lake. Many early explorers in Australia were convinced that a great inland sea lay ahead of them, and several hauled heavy boats on their expeditions.
   All travelers driving across hot country on straight highways have seen retreating pools of water ahead of them. These appear to be deep, shimmering lakes stretching across the road. The pavement has absorbed the sun's heat and rays and is responding like a tinfoil reflector. Although mirages are physical illusions, they are real in an optical sense and can be photographed. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:49	1	2003-02-25 21:23:52
384	Lime	3a	9	10	   Complete silence is found only in laboratories called anechoic rooms. The walls and ceilings, made of blocks of special sound-absorbing materials, are more than three feet thick, while floor coverings are six-foot layers of feathers or cotton wool. Silence here can be as painful to the ears as the din of a steelworks or a rocket blast-off, yet scientists become accustomed to this and stay in these silent rooms for hours at a time, using microphones and electronic equipment to test the various sound-absorbing materials being developed to make the world a less noisy place.
   Architects have used scientific discoveries to solve noise problems in a number of ways. Walls are hollowed and then filled with sound-absorbing materials resembling cotton wool. Extra-thick carpets cover the floors, and thick woolen curtains cover the windows. Air-conditioning and heating ducts are made less noisy by having the air passing through them filter through hundreds of tiny holes in baffles made of sheets of sound- absorbing materials.
   Unfortunately, these techniques and others often work too well in some buildings. Noiseproof rooms become almost anechoic and people living in them are disturbed by the lack of sound. One way of handling this problem is to use what architects call &quot;sound perfume&quot;: artificial noise is piped to rooms through small loudspeakers. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:49	1	2006-06-12 18:01:27
385	Lime	3a	10	10	   Everybody feels pain sometimes: the pain in the head that comes after eating ice cream or drinking cold water; the sudden muscular pain; the &quot;stitch&quot; that attacks long-distance runners or others whose activily has put great demands on the oxygen supply of the body. These transitory pains are not cause for alarm; they usually disappear quickly, return rarely, and signify very little.
   In contrast are the unusual, chronic, or exceptionally severe pains that require attention from a physician, who can determine whether or not they require special care. <i>Angina pectoris</i> (pain of the chest) is a heart pain that lasts from two or three minutes to ten or fifteen. Identification is extremely important, because special drugs are needed for relief and the doctor's understanding and advice may prevent recurrence of the condition.
   Only a doctor can recognize what are called referred pains. These originate at one point, butt are felt at another to which they have been carried by the nerves.
   A person with continuous pain becomes irritated, tires easily, has difficulty in sleeping, loses appetite, and may even become the victim of what has been called an anxiety slate or nervous breakdown. Few diseases develop without pain at some stage, and many involve so characteristic a pain as lo make diagnosis certain. Whenever a pain is so severe, so prolonged, and so unusual as to arouse alarm, a physician should be consulted. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:50	1	2005-05-09 15:17:55
386	Lime	3a	11	10	   There is scarcely a country in the world that does not have its festival of lights - a time of color and of gaiety, marking the triumph of good over evil and the beginning of a new year. This is the theme of the great Hindu festival of Deevali, celebrated widely in Southeast Asia. <i>Deepam</i> means &quot;lamp&quot; and vali &quot;row&quot; or &quot;line&quot; - thus a line of lights in homes, on the fronts of houses, and along streets to banish darkness.
   One of the most popular of the Deevali legends ascribes its beginning to the triumphant return of Prince Rama to his city of Ayodhya to rule his country after fourteen years of exile in the jungle. The people filled their city with lights lo welcome their lord after his defeat of Ravana, the Evil One - symbolizing the triumph of light and righteousness. Linked with the festival also is the victory of Lord Krishna (or Vishnu) over the wicked king Narakasura. As he lay dying, Narakasura is reputed to have asked Krishna for a boon - that the event should be celebrated each year by the people bathing and putting on new clothes.
   For centuries Deevali has been a time of rejoicing in India, especially for children. There are toys and Firecrackers. There are gifts and food for the poor. Incense is burned, and traditional religious drawings are part of the elaborate ceremonies. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:50	1	2006-05-17 17:52:47
387	Lime	3a	12	10	   During the rest of sleep, the fatigue of the body disappears and recuperation begins. The tired mind gathers new energy; the memory improves; and annoyance and problems are seen in better perspective.
   Some adults require little sleep; others need eight to ten hours in every twenty-four. Infants sleep sixteen to eighteen hours daily, the amount gradually diminishing as they grow older. Young students may need twelve hours; university students may need ten. A worker with a physically demanding job may also need ten, where as an executive working under great pressure may manage on six to eight. Many famous people are reputed to have required little sleep. Napoleon Bonaparte, Thomas Edison, and Charles Darwin apparently averaged only four to six hours a night. Whatever your individual need, you can be sure that by the age of thirty you will have slept for a total of more than twelve years. By that age you will also have developed a sleep routine: a favorite hour, a favorite bed, a favorite posture, and a formula you need to follow in order to rest comfortably.
   Investigators have tried to find out how long a person can go without sleep. Several people have reached more than 115 hours - nearly five days. Whatever the limit, it is absolute. Animals kept awake for from Five to eight days have died of exhaustion. The limit for human beings is probably about a week. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:50	1	2003-02-25 21:29:28
388	Lime	3a	13	10	   Charles Dickens's last novel and his only mystery, <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, was led uncompleted when the novelist died, and its possible ending remains a mystery to this day. Is there really a body hidden in the crypt of Cloisterham Cathedral near London? If so, is it the corpse of young engineering student Edwin Drood? Did John Jasper, Drood's opium-smoking uncle, murder his nephew? Of what significance is the late appearance in the story of Dick Dalchcry, a mysterious figure who is evidently in disguise? 
   Various suggestions have been made as to how Dickens intended to conclude his mystery, and in 1914 there was even a mock trial with John Jasper as the accused. Writer G. K. Chesterton was the judge, and playwright George Bernard Shaw was the foreman of a jury composed of famous authors and lawyers. The jurors brought in a verdict of guilty and Chesterton promptly fined them all for contempt of court!
   The most frustrating aspect of forecasting the tale's conclusion is that it is impossible to prove that any given solution is the one Dickens intended. Even a consultation with the novelist himself might not solve the riddle. A medium once claimed to have contacted Dickens's spirit and, upon asking him how he was occupying himself in the spirit world, received the disconcerting reply that he was still trying to solve the mystery of Edwin Drood! 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:50	1	2003-02-25 21:31:39
389	Lime	3a	14	10	   After centuries of avalanche searches, it seems incredible that the best equipment is still a metal rod probing snow, or the nose of a trained dog.
   The basic obstacle is snow's extraordinary efficiency as an insulator - against sound, light, heat, smell, electronics, or any other means of probing its interior. The classic tools, rod and dog's nose, are limited to a layer only a few feet deep. One harrowing enigma is that an avalanche victim can hear his rescuers but they can't hear him. A second problem in rescue is time. In the majority of cases, live rescue is a matter of minutes.
   Modern science has produced devices that will locate a body under snow. One of the most promising, an instrument reacting to magnetism, was costly. An additional drawback was the magnetometer's reacting to any sizable piece of metal or even mineralized ground.
   In 1968, however. Dr. Lawton, a scientist at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, designed a tiny radio transmitter that sends out a directional beep tone. This signal can be picked up by any transistor radio. Avalanche researcher Ed LaChapelle made improvements in the circuit and power supply and gave the system a name: Snow Ranger Finder. Field testing in the United States proved its efficiency. As equipment for the professional who deliberately exposes himself to avalanches every day, the Snow Ranger Finder has great promise. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:50	1	2003-02-25 21:34:48
390	Lime	3a	15	10	   Fortnum & Mason's has a staff of six hundred, a fleet of delivery vans, and hundreds of thousands of customers. Ken Milton owns a small butcher's shop in a tiny village a hundred miles north of London. He has one delivery van, four helpers, and fewer than five hundred customers, but because one of those customers is Queen Elizabeth II, Mr. Milton shares with Fortnum & Mason's the distinction of holding a royal &quot;By Appointment&quot; warrant as a supplier to the British royal family. While Fortnum & Mason's supplies many of the delicacies for slate banquets at Buckingham Palace, Mr. Milton sends meat and poultry to Sandringham, the queen's country residence.
   A royal warrant is regarded as the highest honor an honest trader can earn. It is obtained by serving the queen loyalty, efficiently, and discreetly for a minimum of three years. Even then the warrant is issued on a personal basis to the individual tradesman or the head of the Firm. When he dies or if he goes out of business, the warrant ceases.
   Once a warrant is granted, the holder must be discreet if he is to keep it. Although there must be no undue publicity, a warrant holder can display the royal coat-of-arms outside his premises. He can also use the royal arms on his notepaper, in his advertising, and on the manufactured products he actually supplies to the royal family. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:51	1	2003-02-24 16:27:32
391	Orange	3a	6	6.5	   When the Union Jack fluttered down over Gambia on February 18, 1965, it marked the end of the last outpost of British colonial rule in West Africa. Thousands of Gambians crowded into McCarthy Square in Bathurst, the capital, for the ceremony. One young boy in his best clothes cried out, &quot;It's just like New Year's Day.&quot; 
   The ceremony followed the pattern used by many other British colonies in Africa when they become independent nations. Just before midnight, British Royal Marines marched in solemn half step. They took the salute of the queen's representatives. The crowd stood at attention as the band played &quot;God Save the Queen.&quot; The British flag was lowered slowly. The lights were dimmed. As the new blue, green, and red flag of Africa's smallest independent nation was raised high, the crowd gave a mighty shout. Fireworks burst over the bay. Drums were pounded. And the people danced until dawn. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:51	1	2003-02-24 16:32:23
392	Orange	3a	7	6.5	   Between A.D. 700 and 1100, northern rovers called Vikings explored most of the known world. They even crossed the Atlantic and reached the shores of North America. Yet they had no compasses or other modern instruments. How did they find their way?
   The Vikings stayed near coasts, whenever they could. In open seas they navigated by the sun. On cloudy days they used sun stones. Sun stones were probably pieces of a crystal now called cordierite. This substance has the power to filter sunlight. Peering through a sun stone, a sailor could find out where the sun was and thus plot his ship's latitude.
   Today sky compasses are used to guide some Scandinavian jets across polar regions, where a magnetic compass would be of no use. Though more complex, the sky compass works in the same way as the sun stones used by the Vikings more than a thousand years ago. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:51	1	2003-02-24 17:29:09
393	Orange	3a	8	6.5	   One of the first books printed in English was about hunting with hounds and with birds. The book must have been in great demand: a revised edition was printed ten years later, in 1496. It added a section on angling, also a popular sport. At the time many people believed the writer was Dame Juliana Bemers, the prioress of a nunnery.
   The section on falconry described fourteen classes of birds. Each was suitable to a particular rank. The emperor with his eagle headed the list. Then came king, prince, duke, earl, baron, knight, squire, lady, young man: these were entitled to the knife-winged falcons of various breeds. The author also noted hawks &quot;of a meaner kind.&quot; One was named for each remaining class: yeoman, poor man, priest, and holywater clerk. From the list, it seems that almost everyone shared in this royal sport. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:51	1	2003-02-24 17:33:19
394	Orange	3a	9	6.5	   A tiki is an ornament that looks like a strange human figure. It is bowlegged; it carries its head on one side and its hands on its stomach. The little figure is New Zealand's national good luck charm.
   The first tikis were made long ago by the Maori people of New Zealand. They were worn as fertility emblems by women who wished to have children. Tikis ranged in height from a few centimetres to several inches. Some tikis were made from whalebone that through the centuries took on the gloss of old ivory. But the most treasured tikis were made of greenstone, a dark, clear stone found mainly on New Zealand's South Island. Greenstone is as hard as steel. And the tools the early carvers used were quite crude. As a result, generations of craftsmen sometimes worked on one tiki before it was fashioned to their satisfaction. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:51	1	2003-02-24 17:39:26
395	Orange	3a	10	6.5	   Harold Bate, a British inventor, fuels his car with pigs' manure. But any animal waste will do - dogs', cats', goats', horses', chickens'. Harold's recipe for fuel is simple. He shovels the manure into his methane gas extractor, mixes it with straw and water, and lets the methane bubble through. Then he bottles the fuel, connects the bottle with the special gas converter in his car, and off he goes. The fuel produces no smell or air pollution. It's cheap too. But the British seem to have little interest in it.
   In America, however, Harold has become something of an antipollution folk hero. He gets about fifty letters a week from Americans asking for gas converters. One family wrote to say they'd bought fifteen hens and a goat. Would this give them enough manure, and what kind of car should they buy? &quot;A Cadillac,&quot; Harold wrote back. &quot;They run very well on goats' manure.&quot; 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:52	1	2003-02-24 17:42:51
396	Orange	3a	11	6.5	   A few birds care for their eggs without sitting on them. In Australia, the male mallee fowl builds an incubator nest out of rotting vegetation covered with soil. As the vegetation decays, it gives off heat. The male pokes his beak into the middle of the pile and tests the temperature. If the temperature isn't an even 92 degrees Fahrenheit, he adjusts it by adding or removing soil. 
   The female spends most of her time watching him, but sometimes she helps him. About once a week she lays another egg inside the nest.
   The pair maintain their nest for several months. When the chicks begin to hatch - one by one - they dig their own way out of the nest and dash into the bush to fend for themselves. Although mallee fowl take great care of their eggs, no mallee fowl has ever been seen with a brood of clucks.

   Tuffy worked with divers at the Navy's Man-in-the-Sea station off the coast of California. He acted as messenger to a ten-man team whose underwater home was Sealab II, 205 feet deep. Wearing a plastic harness, Tuffy carried letters in a waterproof tube. He also carried tools for the undersea workers.
   Tuffy learned to answer calls for help. Pretending to be lost, an aquanaut would sound a buzzer. Another aquanaut would fasten one end of a line to Tuffy's harness. Tuffy would speed to the rescue.
   More and more, it seems likely that old tales of dolphins' willingness to help man are closer to truth than to fiction. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:52	1	2003-02-24 18:09:16
398	Orange	3a	13	6.5	   Man's knowledge of the past has sometimes been gained in odd ways. One of the oddest incidents occurred on January 16, 1900. An angry workman broke a crocodile mummy into pieces. He was surprised to find that the mummy had been wrapped in sheets of papyrus, the reed paper of ancient Egypt. And on the papyrus was writing. 
   The diggers at Tebtynis had been searching for papyrus records in the ancient cemetery. Finding crocodile mummies near human mummies had not been surprising: the crocodile had once been looked on as a god. But digging up crocodile mummies had seemed a waste of time.
   In the end, thousands of them were recovered. Most had no papyrus wrappings, but some were stuffed with rolls of papyrus and had the wrappings as well. Scholars found them a useful source of information about life in Egypt a century and a half before Christ. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:52	1	2003-02-24 18:13:11
399	Orange	3a	14	6.5	   The entire family of rays is well armed. The eagle ray's tail has teeth sharp enough to cut off a man's arm. The gray ray can snap its seven-foot tail like a whip. The torpedo ray discharges an electrical current strong enough to knock a man down.
   The stingray has a barb or spine in its tail, with teeth along the edge. At the base of the teeth is a poison gland. When the flexible tail swings upward, the spine can cause a painful wound almost as dangerous as a poisonous snakebite.
   A stingray has been known to lash out so savagely with its tail that the spine sank into an oar two feet above the water. Another ray pierced a boat. One fisherman attacked by a ten-foot ray was struck with such force that the barb went right through his leg, bone and all. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:52	1	2003-02-24 18:18:00
400	Orange	3a	15	6.5	   Some skyscrapers now being built will have built-in devices to help firemen in rescuing people from top floors. Steel bars, much like the rails trains run on, are firmly attached to the outer walls. The rails run straight up the walls between rows of windows.
   During a fire alert at a skyscraper with this device, a special fire engine will arrive. Instead of an extension ladder, the engine will carry a light metal box. On its front is a window; on the back are a door opening and four special wheels. An electric motor that turns the wheels receives its supply of power from the fire engine through a long cable.
   The firemen handle the box so that the wheels grip two adjacent rails on the building. The motor is switched on. The box, with a fireman inside, runs up the wall of the skyscraper where people await rescue at the windows. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:53	1	2003-02-24 18:19:50
401	Purple	3a	1	4.5	   For almost forty years the Empire State Building in New York City was the world's tallest skyscraper. The building reaches a height of 1250 feet. It has 102 floors.
   The use of steel frames made its height possible. Steel walls can rise high without needing to be thick. Steel-frame construction is strong. All plates are fastened together by metal bolts called rivets. When set in place, rivets are usually red-hot. One end is already rounded. A riveter uses a special hammer to shape the other end. Then the rivet cools. It holds the plates firmly.
   High winds can move this strong building. A wind at a hundred miles an hour has swayed it almost one and a half inches.

402	Purple	3a	2	4.5	   A snake is a strange animal. It walks on its ribs and it smells with its tongue. Since its teeth are sharp like needles and not good for chewing, it swallows its food whole.
   The snake's jaws can stretch a great deal. Its body, too, can stretch to several times its normal size. So even a small snake can easily swallow a mouse whole, and a snake just an inch across can gulp down a young bird three inches across. Such a large meal might last the snake for months. In fact, some snakes have been known to go without eating for as long as two years.

403	Purple	3a	3	4.5	   People faint when the normal blood supply to the brain is suddenly cut down. This can happen if they are surprised or shocked by sudden news or by something they see. Some people faint if they see others hurt. Some people faint in crowds. Others faint if they are in a room that is hot and stuffy.
   If a person faints while standing, lay him down. If his face is pale, lift his feet. If he is sitting down when he faints, place his head between his knees. Loosen any tight clothing that might keep him from breathing easily. If possible, place a cold, wet cloth on his forehead.

404	Purple	3a	4	4.5	   Razors were in use in Rome six hundred years before the time of Christ. But they weren't very popular. Then, about 300 B.C., styles changed. Men started shaving every day. Soldiers began to be clean-shaven.
   A trip to the barber could be painful. The Romans had no steel. So their razors were made of iron. And their whiskers were softened just with water.
   Young barbers had to train for a long time before they could open their own shops. Good barbers were those who didn't cut people - too much. They were in great demand. They soon became rich. They must have been sorry to see beards come back into style.

405	Purple	3a	5	4.5	   From time to time a record company makes a gold record. They give it to a singer or musician. They do this when more than a million copies of one of the artist's recordings have been sold.
   Gold records are not made of pure gold. But they aren't just colored gold either. They are plated with gold. First a metal mold is made of the record for which the award is being made. Then the mold is plated with gold.
   Gold records can be played. But they are meant mostly for show. They are costly. To make a gold record can cost more than one hundred dollars, or over forty pounds.

406	Purple	3a	6	4.5	   White spots and lines on the fingernails are said to be signs of good luck. But they are really just flaws in the nails.
   A fingernail is formed by the slow changing of living cells into nonliving tissue. The spots result when some of the cells near the root of the nail fail to change into nail tissue. As the nail grows, the spots are pushed out into view.
   The damage can be done by a slight cut, bruise, or bump near the line where the fresh nail is being formed. Some white spots are caused by poor care of the nails. Or they may result from the nervous habit of biting one's nails.

407	Purple	3a	7	4.5	   The term <i>best man</i> came from Scotland. It was first used in the 1700s. But the custom of having a best man at a wedding goes back much further. It is thought to have started in the days of marriage by capture. A man might seize the bride of his choice and carry her off by force. He would take a faithful friend with him to help fight off the attacks of the girl's family.
   Then as now, bridesmaids were female friends of the bride. They used to help, or pretend to help, to keep the bride from being carried off by the groom and his best man.

408	Purple	3a	8	4.5	   Ben Jonson is one of the few men ever to be buried standing up.
   As the story goes. King Charles I once made him a promise. The king told the great writer that he would be buried in England's famous Westminster Abbey. But that wasn't all. Jonson could choose any place he liked for his grave.
   Jonson died in 1637. Then it was found that the spot he had picked was already filled. The ground space left in it was just eighteen inches square. But Charles kept his word. He had Jonson's coffin placed on its end in the small space. That way it would just fit. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:54	1	2003-02-24 18:23:43
409	Purple	3a	9	4.5	   Few people are surprised when governments care for animals in zoos. But the presence of other animals on a government's payroll may cause wonder. 
   Some animals can be said to work for their keep. Cats on the staff of Britain's Post Office Department and France's National Printing Office earn their pay. They kill the rats and mice that gnaw at and destroy paper.
   Ravens and apes seem unlikely workers. Old tales explain why they are cared for. Legend said that six ravens must be kept at the Tower of London; if not, the British Empire would fall. The Empire has changed, but the ravens remain. The Barbary apes at Gibraltar are also linked with an old tale: if the apes leave the Rock, the British will go. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:54	1	2003-02-24 18:26:22
410	Purple	3a	10	4.5	   The sea horse is a fish, but it does not look like one. And it seldom swims. When it does, it swims upright. It is often found with its tail hooked round seaweed. About five inches tall, its body looks like a matchstick frame covered with fine cloth. Its brown skin matches the seaweed. This makes it hard to find. It feeds on small worms and shellfish, which it sucks off the weed with a tubelike snout. Both male and female have long hairs on the head, but on the male these hairs extend down the back. When the female lays eggs, the male babysits. He keeps the eggs in a pouch until they hatch. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:54	1	2003-02-24 18:27:40
411	Purple	3a	11	4.5	   In the past, animals were often hurt, even killed, when films were made. Horses suffered most. A favorite scene showed horses falling head over heels. A device called the Running W was sometimes used. Long, fine wires were fastened to bands on a horse's front legs and to a log buried in the ground. The horse was made to gallop. The wires tightened, pulling its front legs from under it. Sometimes a pit was dug. Plants hid the opening. The horse would lose its footing when it hit the trench. Such cruel practices are less used today. But still there are films in which animals have been mistreated. Humane societies list these films as unacceptable. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:54	1	2003-02-24 18:29:51
412	Purple	3a	12	4.5	   Bamboo is a giant grass that grows in warm climates. It has many uses. Everything from chairs and fishing rods to rope and paper can be made from it. And that's not all. It can be eaten too.
   In many parts of Asia, bamboo shoots are a favorite food. The winter shoots taste the best. They are soft, with a creamy color. Usually they are boiled in salted water. Spring shoots are darker and harder. They take longer to cook and cost less than winter shoots.
   Fresh bamboo shoots are seldom found outside then native soil. But preserved shoots may be used in their place. They need no cooking and taste almost as good. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:55	1	2003-02-24 18:31:48
413	Purple	3a	13	4.5	   One town of eleven hundred people took part in an experiment run by a watch company. The firm wanted to learn how much people needed clocks and watches. For two days and nights no one used a timepiece. The people &quot;parked&quot; their watches. All public clocks were covered with plastic or cardboard. No church bells chimed. And the fire whistle that usually blew at noon was silent.
   A blast on the fire whistle marked the end of the experiment. The experts talked to 167 townsfolk. The people said they had become fretful and nervous when they didn't know the real (clock) time. Many weren't sure whether they were hungry or not. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:55	1	2003-02-24 18:33:34
414	Purple	3a	14	4.5	   Only two women are known to have been smugglers at sea. Montmorillon, a Frenchwoman, followed in her father's steps. Captaining a brig, she smuggled goods to England.
   Bessie Catchpole took up smuggling when her husband was killed running brandy and tobacco. She dressed in his clothes. With his pipe and cutlass she boarded his yawl, the <i>Sally</i>. The crew gaped when she said she was their captain. One man even laughed. Bessie floored him with a punch on the jaw. This action caused the crew to accept her. A writer says Bessie sold goods to the clergy and gentry. But she was not so popular among customs officers. Like Montmorillon, she was never caught. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:55	1	2003-02-24 18:35:56

   &quot;I said you should check your distributor,&quot; the horse replied.
   The man rushed to the nearest farmhouse. Excitedly he told the farmer what had happened. &quot;Was it an old bay horse with one flop ear?&quot; asked the farmer.
   &quot;Yes, that's the one!&quot;

416	Rose	3a	6	5.5	   Coral reefs are formed by millions of tiny animals called corals. Corals secrete limestone, which hardens into cuplike shapes that stick together. As the animals die, younger corals attach themselves to the old cups. In this way the reef is built up.
   Sometimes corals form odd shapes. Organpipe coral looks like the pipes of an organ. Staghorn coral looks like antlers. And brain coral looks like the human brain.
   Precious corals are found in parts of the Mediterranean Sea and in the Sea of Japan. They are valuable as well as beautiful, and their bright red cores are used for jewelry.
   The most famous coral reef in the world is Australia's Great Barrier Reef. It is about twenty to thirty miles from shore and more than twelve hundred miles long. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:55	1	2003-02-24 18:40:51
417	Rose	3a	7	5.5	  The famous Saint Bernard dogs have saved many travelers lost in storms on the Alps. The dogs' home is a travelers' shelter kept by Augustinian monks. It stands at the highest point of the Great Saint Bernard Pass. For hundreds of years the pass has been used for travel between Switzerland and Italy. The journey was often dangerous.
   Snow and ice still block the pass for months. But the dogs are no longer needed to search it after a storm. In 1964 the Great Saint Bernard Tunnel was opened for motor transport. The tunnel, only three and a half miles long, was the first alpine tunnel for road traffic.
   Motorists are not the only users of the Great Saint Bernard Tunnel. Observers report that swallows now take the tunnel route. It has become part of their spring fly way as they migrate north from Italy. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:56	1	2003-02-24 18:43:02
418	Rose	3a	8	5.5	   Scientists in the United States are trying to breed a tree that will be ideal for city life. They say that in many cities the air is so filled with poisons that the plain, old-fashioned tree is doomed to disappear like the dodo.
   The ideal city tree must have shallow roots. Roots that go down too far get in the way of underground pipes. It must have fairly short branches. Branches that reach too high interfere with overhead lines. The custom-made tree must not drop messy fruit on people's heads, either.
   But most important, the ideal tree for the city must be tough. It must be so tough that insects can't harm it. It must resist disease. And it must be able to withstand the effects of the pollution in the air. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:56	1	2003-02-24 18:48:55
419	Rose	3a	9	5.5	   Many insects disguise themselves to bamboozle their foes. They pretend to be stones, seeds, blades of grass, and even dewdrops. The prize for the best disguise must go to the walking-leaf beetles of India and the Philippines. 
   The eggs of these insects look like seeds. When the young hatch, they are glossy-red copies of the buds sprouting on the bushes they inhabit. The adult beetles' green bodies are shaped and veined to look exactly like the leaves they feed on. Their flat legs resemble small leaves with ragged yellow-stained edges. When it is windy, walking-leaf beetles often hang by two legs and turn their bodies to and fro like breeze-blown leaves. At every stage in life, the walking-leaf beetles can hoodwink their enemies. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:56	1	2003-02-24 21:47:06
420	Rose	3a	10	5.5	   A hermit crab that has found an empty shell for its new home may share its dwelling. It chooses a sea anemone to settle on top of the shell. This flowerlike animal's usual home is on a rock.
   The sea anemone gains by the partnership. As it rides on the shell, it has a better chance of getting food. Pieces of food torn by the crab as it dines may also reach the anemone's mouth.
   The crab profits in its turn. Its enemies find the crab harder to see and to attack. Around the anemone's mouth are tiny arms called tentacles. These shoot out threads that poison and even kill.
   A hermit crab sometimes becomes a &quot;twogun&quot; wanderer. It carries an anemone on each claw of its first pair of legs. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:56	1	2006-07-05 16:11:27
421	Rose	3a	11	5.5	   An octopus is made up of a central mass and eight radiating arms. Suction cups on the arms give the octopus a firm grip. In the mass there is a parrotlike beak. There is also a siphon, which squirts water for jet propulsion when the creature is in a hurry. Because its blood contains copper instead of iron as ours does, the octopus's blood is blue, not red. In most species the skin, or mantle, is thick, tough, and muscular. 
   Octopuses vary in size from a few inches to several feet. They range in habitat from surface waters to depths of two to three miles. Some shallow water octopuses protect themselves by changing color. There are about 150 known species. Other species may yet be discovered. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:56	1	2003-02-25 21:40:06
422	Rose	3a	12	5.5	   Alligators in the sewers of New York City? How could that be? Where had they come from?
   In the 1930s many New Yorkers kept turtles as pets. Then people became interested in keeping other reptiles - like lizards and even alligators. Newly hatched alligators were sent from Florida. They were shipped in small boxes with holes to let in the air. The baby alligators soon grew. They became fierce. They became too hard for most families to handle. Some fathers must have thought that the safest and easiest way to get rid of them was to put them down into the sewers.
   Inspectors saw the alligators in the sewers. They told their superintendent. But he didn't believe them. Then one day he came face to face with an alligator himself. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:57	1	2003-02-24 22:07:22
423	Rose	3a	13	5.5	   Many of our clothes are made from cloth that has polyester in it. Unlike wool, silk, linen, or cotton, polyester is made by man. It is made from elements that come from air, water, coal, and oil. Most polyester is made by melting, in a sealed chamber, chips of a material like plastic. Fibers are then drawn from the melted substance. These fibers are often mixed with wool or cotton to make cloth.
   Polyesters differ because every company has its own way of making polyester. And every company calls its product by a different name.
   But no matter what it is called, all polyester has certain good points. It does not wrinkle easily. It dries quickly after it is washed. It holds its shape. It is strong and keeps its colors well. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:57	1	2004-11-20 10:12:55
424	Rose	3a	14	5.5	   A volcano is a mountain of lava, ash, and cinders. The volcano builds up around a vent, which leads to a lake of molten rock deep in the earth. The vent is really a crack in the earth's crust. Some volcanic mountains have taken centuries to form. Others have grown to great heights in a few weeks. These fiery mountains spew out rivers of red-hot molten rock and clouds of steam and poisonous gases. 
   Although thousands of people have been killed by sudden eruptions, volcanoes also benefit man. Tin, tungsten, gold, and other metals have been brought closer to the earth's surface. Chemicals in the ash have enriched farmland. When solid, lava is a good building material. And in Italy steam from active volcanoes supplies heat and power to surrounding areas. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:57	1	2003-02-24 22:18:43
425	Rose	3a	15	5.5	   Along the coast of Kelantan in Malaysia, men and monkeys have been working partners for countless years. The monkeys help their owners by gathering nuts from coconut palms.
   The coconut monkey is the species called the pig-tailed macaque, <i>berok</i> in Malay. Most working monkeys have been captured in the jungle when a few months old. They must be trained for their task. They learn how to twist a coconut free, first while on the ground and then up in a tree. Next they learn the difference between ripe and unripe nuts, again first on the ground and then in a tree. In lessons that follow they climb higher trees. Their last lesson is on jumping from one tree to another.
   No man can work as fast as a trained <i>berok</i>, and few men work so eagerly. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:57	1	2003-02-25 11:35:06
426	Tan	3a	6	9	   &quot;God made the world, but the Dutch made Holland.&quot; True to this saying, the people of the Netherlands are again &quot;making&quot; their land.
   About 1980 the Netherlands will complete a project begun in the 1920s: transforming the Zuider Zee, an inlet of the North Sea, into dry land and a freshwater lake. By stages, 550,000 acres of land will serve several purposes: industrial, recreational, military, and agricultural. Fed by the river Yssel, the remaining water basin - Lake Yssci, about 300,000 acres - will irrigate the surrounding land and help in the fight against salination. Excess water will drain through sluices into the sea.
   As the first step a nineteen-mile-long barrier dam, rising twenty-five feet above sea level, closed the entrance to the Zuider Zee. Then the centuries-old polder recipe was followed - building dikes and pumping out the water enclosed in order to reclaim the land. An experimental polder of a hundred acres preceded the first and smallest of the main polders - Fifty thousand acres that became dry land in 1930. The fifth and largest polder - 150,000 acres - will be the last of the Zuider Zee works. 
   Farmers for the new polders come from every province. The Eastern Flevoland polder, completed in 1957, became farmland for many from the province of Zeeland, which was badly hit by the disastrous floods of 1953. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:57	1	2003-08-19 12:48:05
427	Tan	3a	7	9	   Grasshoppers of temperate zones are rarely a great nuisance to man. The migratory locusts of the tropics and subtropics are something else. In the second book of the Bible, Exodus, there is a horrifying account of a migration of locusts in Egypt. A modern account of an invasion of locusts in East Africa comes from a man named C. B. Williams.
   &quot;We received a telephone warning shortly after breakfast that an immense swarm of locusts was passing in our direction. An hour or so later the First outfliers appeared - gigantic, deep purple- brown grasshoppers with a six-inch wingspan. Minute by minute, their numbers increased. When they settled they changed the color of the forest; the weight of their numbers broke branches of trees up to three inches in diameter; their noise on the roofs made conversation difficult. . . . The swarm was about one mile wide, over one hundred feet deep, and passed for about nine hours at a speed of six miles per hour; at a conservative estimate it was made up of ten thousand million locusts....&quot;
   Swarms like the one Williams describes can destroy whole harvests at lightning speed, causing famine in invaded areas. This is why research centers have been established to study the behavior of migratory locusts. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:58	1	2003-02-25 11:53:07
428	Tan	3a	8	9	   People everywhere agree on what a mountain is - or do they? The fact is that definitions vary. Everyone admits, for example, that Everest is a mountain, the highest of them all, with an altitude of almost 30,000 feet. But what about Snowdon, the loftiest peak in Wales? It rises a mere 3000 feet, yet it is also called a mountain. Comparison - a little matter of relativity - is the key. To the average person living on North America's Great Plains, Vermont's Green Mountains look lofty indeed: but to anyone from the Rocky Mountains, the Green Mountains seem nothing more than hills.
   Geographers generally agree that, to be a mountain topographically, a landmass must reach an altitude of 3000 feet above the level of the sea. Mount Everest, for instance, is 30,000 feet above sea level, but only 15,000 feet above the neighboring Tibetan plateau. Geologists restrict the definition even more, maintaining that a mountain is a mountain by virtue of its geological structure. Some rugged highlands are not really mountains, while some flat, low-lying rock surfaces are true mountains. They are low now because of centuries of erosion. There are even mountains under the sea - the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, for example. Like all true mountains, they were originally formed by large-scale movements of the earth's crust. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:58	1	2006-02-15 17:50:50
429	Tan	3a	9	9	   Television signals cross a continent by relay towers, which pick up and amplify the straight-line microwave beams. But there is no way to build towers on water, and a signal sent across the sea could not follow the curve of the earth. Its straight-line beam would soar off into space. 
   Scientists have solved this problem by designing a new kind of tower, a lower in the sky - a satellite. An active satellite contains amplifiers much like those in the overland microwave towers. When a microwave is beamed to it from a ground transmitter, the satellite increases the strength of the signal and reflects it to a ground receiving station beyond the curve of the globe. 
   Technologists know enough today to place a satellite system in medium-range altitudes, from about 5000 to 8000 miles in space. A system of about Fifty satellites would provide many circuits, which would cover the present communication needs of the world. Telephone and telegraph messages would be carried at high speed. TV broadcasts would be shared internationally.
   Plans have also been studied for high-altitude satellites as much as 22,000 miles off in space, but there are still problems with these. Some way must be found to fix such satellites in a firm position so that they will always be &quot;on station.&quot; 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:58	1	2003-02-25 12:00:34
430	Tan	3a	10	9	   The territory that now makes up the United States was settled by people from England, France, Holland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and other countries. The Indians, of course, were already there.
   Naturally, the nationalities in the colonies called one another by slang terms. Often the slang terms came from some name that was popular among a particular group. The equivalent of the English -name James, for instance, is the common Spanish name Diego, pronounced &quot;dee-ay'goh.&quot; That gives rise to the insulting word <i>Dago</i> applied to a Spaniard or to other South Europeans, such as the Italians. 
   The English in Connecticut were subjected lo this same irritating device by the Dutch who, prior to 1664, occupied New Amsterdam (later New York). A common name among the English is John and lo the Dutch this was Jan, pronounced &quot;yan.&quot; What was more natural than for the Dutch to call any Englishman Jan? To make it more condescending and insulting, they used the diminutive form <i>Janke</i> (equivalent to Johnikins in English). This was pronounced &quot;yan'kuh,&quot; and that easily became <i>Yankee</i>.
   The term, which originally applied to natives of Connecticut, later applied to all New Englanders and was eventually given to all Northerners by the Southerners and to all Americans by people of other countries. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:58	1	2004-07-26 14:53:08
431	Tan	3a	11	9	   It is difficult to think of a nation as an abstract collection of people living on a patch of territory. It is easier to think of it as a person. This is why we sometimes call Great Britain &quot;Britannia&quot; and the United States &quot;Columbia,&quot; and think of both as stately women.
   We also use masculine symbols in our personification of nations. In 1712 John Arbuthnot, a Scot, wrote a political satire in which the characters were supposed to be typical members of different nationalities. The Englishman was John Bull. This name, which was sufficiently fluttering to be adopted generally, combined the most common English first name with a lust name indicating strength. John Bull is usually pictured as a portly businessman with a Union Jack on his hatband.
   After the American War of Independence ended in 1783, the United Slates was known as &quot;Brother Jonathan.&quot; Jonathan was a biblical name associated with simple people from rural areas, and it seemed fitting since the United States was rural and unsophisticated, and since Americans considered their type of simplicity a virtue compared with the wickedness of European cities. It is possible, however, that the name originated with President George Washington, who would often say, when faced with a hard problem, &quot;Let us consult Brother Jonathan,&quot; referring to his secretary, Jonathan Trumbull. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:58	1	2003-02-25 21:46:53
432	Tan	3a	12	9	   Natives and other people used to living in the tropics can stand heat much better than newcomers. Similarly, among troops stationed in hot areas casualties from heatstroke are always highest among recent arrivals. Obese persons are particularly endangered by heat, and the rate of heat ailments among overweight people is three to five times as high as among the slim.
   Even in outer space, with its very low temperatures, heat problems can occur. Space capsules and space suits have to be conditioned to keep a careful balance between the heat gained from the sun, the heat and moisture produced by the metabolism of crew members, and the heat lost into space. When this balance fails, the results can be quite unpleasant. This was the case during astronaut Richard Gordon's space walk on the <i>Gemini 11</i> mission in 1966. Temperatures in his space suit rose to 43 degrees C, or nearly 110 degrees F.  The relative humidity in his suit rose to 100 percent, or saturation, from moisture produced by perspiration and breathing. This environment caused physical deterioration. Gordon's pulse rate rose to 180 beats per minute and he was unable to perform simple tasks. For a time his situation was dangerous. Only a superbly conditioned man could have survived. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:59	1	2003-02-25 21:51:30
433	Tan	3a	13	9	   The word <i>encyclopedia</i> begun us a Greek word and means &quot;instruction in the whole circle.&quot; It was first used in English by Sir Thomas Elyot in 1538. Encyclopedias today are usually arranged in alphabetical order, but in early times they were arranged in any way the author liked. One writer in the Middle Ages began with a discussion of God and angels and ended with descriptions of scents and colors and a list of thirty-six different kinds of eggs. The First alphabetically arranged encyclopedia was published in 1704 by an English clergyman named John Harris.
   The oldest encyclopedia in existence was written during the First century A.D. by Pliny, a Roman. Its thirty-seven volumes list over twenty thousand items. It was valued highly for hundreds of years. Up to 1536 forty-three editions had been published. The largest encyclopedia, the third Chinese encyclopedia, contains over 5020 volumes and was compiled during the eighteenth century. Between 1751 and 1765 the French <i>Encyclopedia</i> appeared. This collection is unusual because contemporary famous men, including Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot, wrote articles for it.
   The <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> is probably the best-known work for English-speaking peoples. It First appeared in Scotland in 1771. In 1961 the World Book Company published a braille edition of its own encyclopedia for blind readers.

434	Tan	3a	14	9	   Natural gas began with the plant and animal life of the earth's prehistoric seas. Dead organisms settled on the ocean floor and were covered by layers of mud, silt, and sand. Over time, the organic matter was changed into gas and oil through decay, heat, and pressure, and the layers of mud, silt, and sand were compressed into solid rock. As millions of years passed, these rock layers buckled and shifted, and accumulations of gas and oil were displaced and became trapped beneath masses of nonporous, impervious rock. 
   Primitive man discovered natural gas quite by accident. The temple fires of Baku on the Caspian Sea were fired by natural gas seeping from rock fissures, and worshipers of fire journeyed to Baku from as far away as India. The mysterious &quot;burning springs&quot; in North America and elsewhere were also evidence of escaping gas, probably ignited by lightning.
   The first industrial application of natural gas was made by the Chinese. Gas transported by bamboo pipes was burned to evaporate brine and produce salt. Today there are some twenty-six thousand industrial uses for natural gas, and new uses are constantly being developed.
   Gas manufactured from coal was first produced early in the seventeenth century. Because of its elusive nature, it was called <i>geest</i>, meaning &quot;ghost&quot; - hence, some say, our word gas. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:59	1	2005-06-07 17:44:30
435	Tan	3a	15	9	   Using a delta-winged kite based on one designed by Leonardo da Vinci over four hundred years ago. Bill Moyes, an auto electrician in Australia, has succeeded in doing what man has been trying to do for more than two thousand years. Moyes has flown more than a mile and a half at an altitude of a thousand feet in what is believed to be the world's longest unassisted flight.
   After one failure, Moyes made three successful flights from the top of Mount Crackenback. Each time he rode the chair lift to the top of the mountain and then, with the kite on his back, skied about a thousand feet down the steepest slope. Reaching a speed of about thirty miles per hour, he soured into the air, accelerated to about forty- five miles per hour, and sailed gracefully down into the valley. Each time he circled over the ski village of Thredbo before he landed, twice in the snow and once in the village. Each flight lasted about two minutes.
   The kite was made of terylene on a light metal frame, with an area of 125 square feet and a weight of 125 pounds. It was designed by John Dickenson, also an Australian, and built by Bill Moyes. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:59	1	2003-02-25 13:07:38
436	Violet	3a	6	5	   Warm water freezes more quickly than cold. Sir Francis Bacon said that almost four hundred years ago. But few people believed him - till 1970. In that year Canadian scientist George Kell proved the English scholar was right. Dr. Kell filled an open pail with cold water. He filled another with warm water. He exposed both to the same low temperature. The warm water froze first.
   The lack of covers on the pails was the secret. Some of the warm water changed to vapor. It evaporated into the air. This meant that less of the warm water was left to freeze. And so the warm water froze faster than the cold water - even though it had a greater temperature drop to make. 		1	2002-11-06 08:36:59	1	2003-02-25 13:09:48
437	Violet	3a	7	5	   Doughnuts were once just fried, round cakes. The first doughnuts, with holes were probably made in the United States.
   People in Rockport, Maine, give the credit to a sea captain from their area. The captain was eating a fried cake at sea one stormy night. When he needed both hands to steer, he rammed the cake over a spoke of the ship's helm. He liked the result. He asked the cook to start making cakes with holes already in them.
   In Plymouth, Massachusetts, people tell a different story. One day a local pioneer woman was frying cakes. As she dropped one into the hot fat, a stray arrow shot by a hunter pierced its center. This, they say, was the first holed doughnut. 		1	2002-11-06 08:37:00	1	2003-02-25 13:12:31
438	Violet	3a	8	5	   Work was to start on the first bridge across the Niagara gorge. Ice floes made crossing by boat impossible. The American engineer T. G. Hulett did not wish to wait until spring. He offered ten dollars to anyone who could fly a kite across. 
   Many boys tried. Swift air currents carried kites down into the river instead of up and over it. After a day of trying, only one boy stayed. Just after dusk, Homan Walsh's second kite made the crossing. Three men caught it. Then Hulett attached a heavy rope to the kite string. The men hauled it over. A larger rope followed. Finally a heavy wire cable was pulled across. 
   The Niagara Suspension Bridge, begun by a kite, was completed in 1848. 		1	2002-11-06 08:37:00	1	2003-02-25 21:55:28
439	Violet	3a	9	5	   Most typewriters have &quot;qwerty&quot; keyboards. The name comes from the first six letters on the board's second line. The &quot;qwerty&quot; board was set up by C. L. Sholes. Sholes was the first man to make a really good typewriter.
   Some letters, such as <i>S</i> and <i>T</i>, are used together a great deal in English. Sholes placed such pairs of letters far apart on his keyboard. This made it harder for typists to learn the keyboard. But it helped keep typewriters from jamming. On early machines the bars holding the letters often caught on each other when moving quickly.
   Sholes made the name of his machine easy to type. He placed on the same line all the letters of the words <i>type</i> and <i>writer</i>. 		1	2002-11-06 08:37:00	1	2003-02-25 13:18:13
440	Violet	3a	10	5	   Small children often laugh at a lame or blind person, or at someone who isn't dressed as well as they are. But as they grow up, they learn not to hurt people's feelings by laughing at their problems. They learn to laugh at other things. Most important, they learn to laugh at themselves.
   Suppose you're playing a game. You make a silly mistake and lose. Do you become angry? Or can you laugh at yourself and hope to do better next time? Suppose you're at a special dinner. You accidentally spill some food. Why keep worrying about how clumsy you looked? Why not laugh it off and enjoy yourself anyway? If you can, it's a good sign you've really grown up. 		1	2002-11-06 08:37:00	1	2003-02-25 13:22:30
441	Violet	3a	11	5	   The tune for &quot;London Bridge is falling down&quot; has some new words. American children have sung &quot;London Bridge is going up.&quot; Stone by stone - 10,246 in all - the bridge across the Thames was taken down. At Lake Havasu City in Arizona it was rebuilt. Water from the Colorado River flows under its arches.
   The old words were never true of the bridge that has crossed the ocean. They described the bridge that it replaced in 1831. Old London Bridge, opened in 1209, often needed repairs. Ice caused much damage. Fire razed buildings on the bridge. But it was used for more than six hundred years. Then, like the bridge that replaced it, it became unable to handle the growing traffic of London. 		1	2002-11-06 08:37:00	1	2003-02-25 13:24:09
442	Violet	3a	12	5	   Taking pictures is fun. And taking good ones is easy if you follow a few simple rules. Before you snap a picture, think about it. Be sure you are close enough to your subject. A pretty face against a plain background, for instance, makes a good picture. But a distant Figure lost among trees and clouds lacks interest. In a landscape scene, try to keep at least two-thirds of the picture below the line where the ground meets the sky. For a sky scene, keep at least two-thirds of the picture above that line.
   Study pictures in newspapers and books. Try to see why some are better than others. Use what you learn to improve your own pictures. 		1	2002-11-06 08:37:01	1	2003-02-25 13:25:33
443	Violet	3a	13	5	   A girl was once walking along a country lane. All at once her surroundings seemed to fade. She saw her mother lying on the floor of an unused room at home. The sight seemed so real that the girl went at once to fetch a doctor. When they reached her home, she led the doctor to the unused room. There lay the mother just as the girl had seen her. She had had a sudden heart attack. The doctor arrived just in time to save her life. 
   The girl's vision may have been an example of clairvoyance. Clairvoyant people seem to have an unexplained power that lets them see objects and events too far away for natural sight. 		1	2002-11-06 08:37:01	1	2003-02-25 13:26:51
444	Violet	3a	14	5	   The lotus is a kind of water lily. It grows in many lands. At night it closes. It sinks down in the water. At dawn it rises to face the new day. From early times the lotus has held deep meaning. The Egyptians of long ago noticed its pattern of sinking and rising again. They saw it as a sign of life after death. The Maya Indians of America had a type of lotus too. To them it was the sign for Earth. To those of the Buddhist faith, the lotus stands for Buddha. They say a lotus sprang up to tell of his birth. The lotus has meaning for Hindus too -since the god Brahma was born in a lotus bloom. 		1	2002-11-06 08:37:01	1	2003-02-25 13:29:23

522	Orange	4a	1	9	The welcome which a Kurdish tribe gives a guest is not only hearty, but it is a bloody affair as well. On the outskirts of the village a delegation of men hold a steer ready for the slaughter, and, as the guest approaches, one of the tribesmen stabs the animal in the throat. There is the last agonizing moment when the steer lets loose a bloody, gurgling bellow before it is dragged across the road, leaving a stream of blood in its wake. The guest then steps across the blood. The  executioner saws vigorously on the neck of the beast until the head is severed and then heaves it to the side of the road. The khan, or other ranking host, turns to the guest, takes him by the hand, and says in a loud,  ringing voice, &quot;May that happen to the heads of all your enemies.&quot; The new arrival is now a member of the tribe. He has special privileges, too. Each tribesman would give his life to defend him. Every man, woman, and child will cater to his needs and show him every courtesy. People of the Western world also want to receive their guests cordially, but the Western version of hospitality certainly seems far less extreme. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:51	1	2003-09-19 15:28:33
523	Orange	4a	2	9	If Jacques Cartier, the first of the early explorers to challenge North America's mighty St. Lawrence River, were available for  comment on the present shape of things along the St. Lawrence, he would be caught up in the wonder of one of man's greatest engineering feats of this or any other century. He would witness the drama of man against the river: thousands of men and great machines carving out a 27-foot-deep channel that will open an ocean waterway from the Atlantic to the extremities of the Great Lakes. An on-the-scene engineer with a leaning toward statistics could tell the visiting fifteenth-century explorer that the earth and rock being moved would fill a 27,000-mile-long train of 50-ton hopper cars. Overwhelming is the word to describe what is happening on the St. Lawrence. But it could be that the amazement of the earlier-day visitor would be exceeded by the gratification of seeing two  neighboring nations, whose very existence gives the explorer a claim to  immortality, combining their skills and resources to tame the torrents of a mighty river and harness its energy for the ultimate benefit of all mankind. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:51	1	2003-07-22 07:03:24
524	Orange	4a	3	9	The theatre is like a small stadium: its rows on rows of tiered seats, holding over 15,000 excited spectators, encircle the huge stage  a  platform more than 300 feet long  upon which every pair of eyes is focused. On this stage two men are fighting to the death. This is a play, and the two men who are fighting have roles in the play; but the script calls for one of them to die, and the spectators, accustomed to seeing actual death in gladiatorial contests, will not be cheated with mere imitation. The actor who is to die knows it; beneath his mask he is perspiring with fright, his body is trembling. Any attempt to escape would be punished not only by death, but by torture as well. The  audience is urging the fighters on, licking its lips in expectation of the kill. The fight reaches a climax; the despairing slave meets his destined death giving one last shiver of agony as his blood stains the stage. The audience sighs with pleasure and then forgets him. That was the theatre of Rome in its decline. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:51	1	2003-07-22 15:08:40
525	Orange	4a	4	9	Every word on a label describing a food, a drug, a cosmetic, or a medical device is important in protecting you and your family from buying an inferior product, from misusing a good one, from being tricked by dangerous quackery, or from unknowingly possessing an item harmful to health. First of all, the label on a can or package of food must be completely truthful. If a loaf of bread is made with soy flour, the loaf cannot be labeled as white bread. A label must not be misleading. This restriction is somewhat vague and therefore cannot prevent all violations. Although the government tries to eliminate all misleading labels, the consumer must nevertheless be always on guard. Just because a can of sardines has a fancy-sounding foreign name, don't take for granted that the fish were imported. It is the law, too, that manufacturers must list their names and places of business on their labels. Manufacturers must use common names in identifying their products so that anyone can readily understand what he is buying. Synthetic foods must be prominently labeled as artificial. Foods composed of two or more ingredients must bear labels listing all ingredients in the order of predominance. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:51	1	2003-08-19 08:03:07
526	Orange	4a	5	9	Our sun is actually an orange, dwarf star. Although it is not nearly the hottest star known, its surface temperature is about 10,000° F. and that of its interior is thought to be in the range of 20,000,000° F. We commonly think of the sun as burning; yet it is too hot to burn and is composed of elemental gases. The sun is 865,000 miles in diameter and has a mass one-third of a million times greater than the earth's. Scientists believe that it is two billion years old and, instead of cooling, is still getting hotter. Perhaps, within the next two billion years, it will reach a temperature of sufficient intensity to destroy the earth. The sun's corona, or halo, is almost as hot as its interior. Solar prominences  tongues of hot gas  leap outward a half-million miles from the sun's surface at speeds reaching 250,000 miles an hour. Fortunately, these prominences do not travel the full ninety-three million miles to earth, nor are their terrific temperatures transmitted through space. Some of the energy from these disturbances does reach our atmosphere, however, and is believed to cause changes in weather. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:52	1	2003-08-19 08:04:19
527	Orange	4a	6	9	In primitive societies sick people had to rely on medicine men and witch doctors. ( Some people still rely on them. ) It was believed that a person was sick because he had been attacked by evil spirits. The witch doctor's job was to drive off these spirits. His technique involved a combination of three methods, the first of which was religious. He chanted magic words and used good luck charms which he thought had power over the evil spirits that supposedly had entered the victim's body. Secondly, he deliberately fed the patient mixtures, which were often filthy and disgusting, to make the evil spirits so uncomfortable that they would gladly run away and so enable the patient to get well. The third method was to give the patient medicines prepared from certain plants and herbs that were similar in shape or texture to the various organs of the body. From our point of view, this was the only method that had any value. Modern scientific study has shown that some of these remedies had real usefulness in curing sickness, or at least in relieving pain, but not for the reasons advanced by the witch doctor. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:52	1	2003-07-22 15:43:38
528	Orange	4a	7	9	Many stories have attempted to explain the origin of the well-known warning, &quot;Mind your p's and q's.&quot; One legend even claims that its derivation is from &quot;pints&quot; and &quot;quarts&quot; so freely quaffed in taverns long ago. One of the most interesting theories connects the expression to court etiquette in the time of Louis XIV. Nobles were required to follow a complicated routine of bowing and bending as they approached the throne. Not only were they in danger of making a misstep, but also they were likely to disarrange or even knock off their huge, cumbersome wigs. Consequently, it came to be proverbial that courtiers and officials had to pay careful attention to their pieds (feet) and queues (wigs). Adopted and abbreviated by the British, the expression could have become &quot;Mind your p's and q's.&quot; Intriguing though that explanation may be, it is a less probable one than another which traces its origin to the household. Before public school education was generally practiced, mothers frequently taught their children in the home. Because handwritten p's and q's look so much alike, the housewife-teacher probably often warned her pupils, &quot;Mind your p's and q's.&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:52	1	2003-07-22 15:44:58
529	Orange	4a	8	9	Money is not always composed of dimes, quarters, half dollars, and bills. For instance, German currency was nearly valueless immediately after World War II. Because American soldiers in the Occupation Forces had ready supplies of cigarettes, which the Germans wanted but were unable to get, they paid for purchases with cigarettes. Germans, in turn, used cigarettes as money. Marketable products were priced in terms of so many cigarettes or packs of them; Germany was, in fact, on a temporary &quot;cigarette standard&quot; of money. Throughout history, a variety of strange things has been used for money. In ancient times, the Romans bought and sold goods for cattle. Some Indians, when trading, used strings of beads called &quot;wampum.&quot; Sea shells, grindstones, coconuts, and feathers were other queer kinds of money. From ages past to the present, numerous peoples have employed various metals  iron, copper, silver, and gold  as money. Of course, one of the most common types of money, especially since the art of printing was invented, has been a piece of paper with the right kind of printing on it. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:52	1	2003-07-22 15:47:08
530	Orange	4a	9	9	The potential of closed-circuit television and other new electronic teaching tools is so great that it is fascinating to visualize &quot;the school of tomorrow.&quot; Televised lessons will originate from a central building having perhaps four or five master studios. The lessons will be carried into classrooms all over a city, or even an entire county. After a televised lesson has been given, the classroom teacher will take over for the all-important &quot;follow-up&quot; period. The students will ask any troublesome questions, and difficult points will be cleared up through discussion. The teacher in the classroom will have additional electronic tools. On the teacher's desk, the traditional bright red apple will have been replaced by a multiple-control panel and magnetic tape players. The tape machines will run pre-recorded lessons which pupils will follow by headphones. The lessons will be specifically geared to the students' levels of ability. For instance, while the class as a whole studies history, each student will receive an individual history lesson, directed to his particular level of ability. Should questions arise, the students will be able to talk directly to the teacher on individual &quot;intercoms&quot; without disturbing the rest of the class. In this way, the teacher will be able to conduct as many as three classes at the same time. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:52	1	2003-07-22 15:49:09
531	Orange	4a	10	9	No organ of the body is less appreciated than the skin. One of our biggest and busiest organs  and the most telltale  it mirrors the state of our health, our age, and our race. Occupation and way of life may also become indelibly imprinted for all to see. Here are some facts about our outer covering organ to show that there is more to the skin than meets the eye. Your skin is your body's thermostat. It regulates heat gain and loss so that the internal temperature remains within the normal range of 97 to 99 degrees. It takes about two square yards of skin to cover the average adult from head to toe. Undoubtedly the most intricate wrapping in existence, the skin contains three million cells, three feet of blood vessels, and twelve feet of nerves in each area the size of a postage stamp. The widest difference between the darkest human skin and that of an albino is brought about by not more than 1/25 of an ounce of melanin. As far as is known, the amount of this dark brown or black pigment accounts for all our variations in racial colors, including yellow, brown, and black. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:52	1	2003-08-19 08:05:29
532	Orange	4a	11	9	On May 25, in the year 585 B.C., a terrifying darkness fell upon the Greek city of Miletus. In the market place and on the water front, merchants and sailors fell on their knees and implored almighty Zeus and glorious Apollo not to destroy the sun. At the same time, Thales, a scholarly statesman of Miletus, watched the event with a lively interest quite removed from fear of disaster. He knew that the darkness was due to an eclipse of the sun. He had, in fact, predicted it through his calculations based on a chart given to him by the astronomers of Babylon, recording the movements of stars and planets. He knew, too, that the darkness was actually caused by the moon as it passed between the earth and sun  not to the whim of one of the gods  and that it was in accord with an eternal law in which men could have complete faith. Thales was the first of the Greek philosophers, but others followed him. These Greek philosophers continued to question, study, and speculate, always seeking better explanations than those in the myths invented by their forefathers. The basic truths they discovered centuries ago helped free the minds of all men from ignorance and superstition. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:52	1	2003-08-19 08:06:22
533	Orange	4a	12	9	Although the Arabian camel, or dromedary, can go without drinking for a long while, its hump does not store water as is commonly believed. The real secret of the animal's unusual ability to store water lies in the fact that very little of the camel's water is lost by evaporation through the skin. Instead of sweating out great quantities of water, the camel's body temperature rises, sometimes as much as eleven degrees, to compensate for external heat. When a camel does require water, it replaces only the amount lost since its last drink. In Egypt, between November and April, the camel can go for three or four months without drinking if it grazes in lush pastures where dew and showers keep the vegetation green. If only dry feed is available, the camel will get thirsty after several weeks  even during January. The length of time a camel can go without drinking is greatly determined by time of year, force of wind, heat in the air, intensity of sunlight, amount of reflected heat, kind of feed, weight of the load carried, speed the animal travels, and number of hours spent daily in travel. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:53	1	2003-07-22 15:56:43
534	Orange	4a	13	9	A sports car is a high-performance roadster, built to stick to the road even on curves that throw ordinary cars onto the shoulders. A manual gearshift, a firm  some would call it rough  ride) and powerful brakes are the features which generally characterize the sports car; yet the fans often disagree about a particular car's qualifications. Nothing irks a purist more than hearing the words &quot;sports car&quot; applied to an ordinary soft-sprung roadster or to a closed car. Fun, not transportation, is the main idea behind sports cars. They are, quite simply, a pleasure to drive  sensitive and responsive. For a man with mechanical ability, they also are fun to work on. A mass of technical information is available to the owner. Easily accessible, and with such features as overhead valves, the sports car engine is &quot;built to be worked on.&quot; The majority of owners probably do their own tuning and puttering. Many sports cars are tame enough for ordinary city driving. Owners point out these distinct city advantages: economy of fuel and garage space, and ease of handling in traffic and in parking. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:53	1	2003-07-22 15:57:57
535	Orange	4a	14	9	In Labrador, a country so cold that meat is preserved by freezing it outdoors, Clarence Birdseye came to notice that meat which was frozen on the coldest days had a better flavor than meat frozen at other times. Being curious, he studied preserved meats under the microscope and found that if meat were frozen quickly on a very cold day, ice crystals did not have time to form long needles and the meat cells were not damaged. Birdseye believed that if he could freeze other foods very rapidly, the same thing might happen. But, since there are not many days when the temperature drops 40 or 45 degrees below zeroeven in Labrador some way had to be found to freeze things rapidly without depending on the weather. Remembering that salty water can get very cold without freezing, Birdseye placed some cabbages in salt water and then exposed them to freezing winds. The cabbages froze quickly. Later, Birdseye invented a machine to freeze foods while they were very fresh. Today, stores sell a great variety of frozen foods, and some foods that were once available only in certain districts or in season are now readily available in most communities in any season. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:53	1	2003-07-22 15:59:24
536	Orange	4a	15	9	Cars of 1978 will travel the nation's highways in never-before- dreamed-of safety, comfort, and convenience. These cars will float along never touching the ground, and therefore will have no need for wheels. Annoying highway vibrations, caused by the rotations of the conventional disc-and-tire wheels, will be things of the past. The coming highway cruisers and large passenger cars will literally fly above the road, supported on columns of air compressed by turbine-driven, ducted fans. The car without wheels has been called a &quot;flying car,&quot; and, in a sense, that's just what it is; however, it will not back out of the family garage, start down the street, and then suddenly zoom upward heading for some distant point. On the contrary, to avoid problems in aerial navigation and three-dimensional traffic, the wheelless vehicle probably will travel no more than three inches above road surface. It will travel over fairly rough terrain, and even over smooth water! The inevitable problems of maritime regulations, severe weather conditions, and running out of fuel in secluded areas all will require new concepts of operation, servicing, and vehicle regulation. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:53	1	2003-07-22 16:01:00
537	Orange	4a	16	9	A little after nine o'clock in the morning of October 17, 1781, in the midst of the smoke and roar of the bombardment, a drummer was seen beating a parley on the parapet of the hornwork that defended the most southerly corner of the British fortifications at Yorktown. &quot;Had we not seen the drummer in his red coat,' young Ebenezer Denny, who had been in the trenches all night with the Pennsylvania line, wrote in his diary, &quot;he might have beat away till doomsday. The constant firing was too much for the sound of a single drum.&quot; Immediately, an officer holding up a white handkerchief appeared outside the works. The drummer joined him, beating his drum. The French and American batteries ceased fire. An officer ran out from the American lines to meet the British officer and tied the handkerchief over his eyes. In the blessed silence, all eyes watched as the drummer boy was sent back and the blindfolded British officer was led through the lines to a farmhouse in the rear. &quot;When the firing ceased,&quot; noted Ebenezer in his little diary, &quot;I thought I never heard a drum equal to it, the most delightful music to us all.&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:53	1	2006-05-31 12:39:56
538	Orange	4a	17	9	In 1799, George Washington, in a letter written only two days before his death, strongly urged the establishment of a military academy. Three years later, the United States Military Academy opened with an enrollment of ten cadets. By 1902, the Corps of Cadets had increased to nearly 2,500. Each July, a new class enters the Military Academy. These new cadets come from cities and farms; their fathers are mechanics, farmers, lawyers  the men of America. A young man need not be a &quot;quiz kid&quot; or a star athlete to qualify for West Point. The standards are fairly high; but any healthy, normally intelligent American male between the ages of 17 and 21, with proper preparation, can qualify. He must be a citizen of the United States and must be of good moral character. He must never have been married. A cadet soon learns that he is on his own, and that only by character, ability, and effort can he get ahead at West Point. Each cadet must prepare himself for a recitation at each class attendance. He is marked on this recitation. This system, instituted by Colonel Sylvanus Thayer in 1817, helps develop in the cadet a confidence in his own abilities. Instructors are glad to give assistance, but only after the cadet has done the original thinking. Although approximately 40 per cent of the cadet's schooling is allotted to military training, the Military Academy offers a balanced program of science and humanities courses, which leads to the granting of a Bachelor of Science degree upon graduation. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:53	1	2003-07-22 16:03:22
539	Orange	4a	18	9	Modem mass-production methods lower the cost of making goods, and thus give us better values. At the same time, American ingenuity and science are constantly at work improving the quality of products. In this way, better quality products at good values are continually being brought to the people of all income groups. As an example of how this works, when facial tissues were first put on the market in 1924, they were made in limited quantities and sold at 65 cents per box of 200. People liked these facial tissues immediately and began asking for them when they went into different stores. Because there was such a demand for the product, manufacturers began making tissues in larger and larger quantities. Because the manufacturers were making tissues in greater quantities, their production costs were lowered, so that the cost of tissues went down. In the meanwhile, the quality of facial tissues was constantly improving, because more manufacturers went into the business of making tissues, and each manufacturer strove to make his product better than his competitors'. Today, instead of costing 65 cents, a box of 200 facial tissues costs around one-third of that price, and they are both softer and stronger. When people are free to compete  when they are free to make more things and make them better  everyone benefits. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:53	1	2003-07-22 16:04:42
540	Orange	4a	19	9	There is, perhaps, no other sport in the world quite so exciting as siding. For viewers, it is a spectacle of unsurpassed beauty. For skiers, it is a vivid personal experience, a thrilling test of mind, muscle, and nerves. And more and more, Americans are discovering this thrill for themselves. Not too long ago, skiing had virtually no part in the American sports scene. If it were thought of at all, it was purely as a European sport. Then came the 1932 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York. Americans got their first good look at skiing and made for the hills. Today ski trains make regular runs from our cities to the great, white outdoors. Lodges and chalets dot the mountain sides offering skiers the warmth of their firesides. In addition to joy and exhilaration, skiing offers other attractions. It is a comparatively inexpensive sport, and, for the young, the art of skiing is often mastered in a very short time. The special thrill of skiing is well described by Buddy Werner. &quot;It's all up to you,&quot; he says. &quot;No teammates can help. You're alone. It's you against the snow, the mountains, the terrain, yourself. You're a warrior.&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:54	1	2003-07-22 16:06:23
541	Orange	4a	20	9	Surfing  the art of riding a wave on a pointed board  is the wildest, fastest natural water sport known to man. In recent years, it has developed into a major sport around the world, from Australia to South Africa. Husky Aussies brave man-eating sharks to ride the green waves Down Under; Hawaiian experts risk their lives on huge, thirty-foot swells on the windward side of Oahu; Californians of all ages go out the year-round. In the winter, surf-riders don waterproof survival suits to ride gray waves so cold that their flesh turns blue and their unprotected muscles knot. Surfing is no sport for weaklings. Swimming a quarter of a mile or more, and pushing a surfboard out to where the swells are just right for launching, can be real work. Then, at precisely the right moment, you mount your aquatic steed and go slashing across the face of a powerful swell with the white water foaming at your heels. The hissing crest of the huge wave bites at your shoulder, threatening at any moment to smash you flat. In the next several seconds, a cool head and lightningquick reflexes will bring your board under control for that majestic ride down the back of the great, green mountain of water. Once on the beach, you know why surfing is growing in popularity as an international sport, and you're glad to be a member of this new water fraternity. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:54	1	2003-08-19 08:09:34
542	Olive	4a	1	10	The body of primitive man, a faraway and primitive man called Homo sapiens, so far as we can reconstruct from the fragmentary evidence we have, was exactly like our own, and his brain was as big as that of modern man and quite as complicated in structure. His intelligence and his ability to learn were probably as great as that of the average man today, but he had a very meager inheritance of knowledge. The use of tools and weapons of a primitive sort was probably passed on from the subhuman creatures, who had learned how to break stones and use the sharp-edged pieces for cutting and scraping, and how to use a short, heavy stick for a club and a long, pointed one for a spear. The subhuman creatures knew how to make use of fire when they found it, but they did not know how to make it. They had probably also discovered the advantages of social living: that several families living together in a tribe could offer each other help and protection, and that hunters killed more game if they banded together and had a leader to direct the hunt. The discovery that social living increased the odds in favor of survival was, perhaps, primitive man's greatest discovery  greater than either the discovery of fire or the invention of the wheel. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:54	1	2003-07-22 16:54:59
543	Olive	4a	2	10	On a mountain peak near Cap Haitien, Haiti, lies the Citadelle, one of the wonders of the world, a monument to a waiter who led his people from slavery only to rule over them as a tyrannical despot. King Henri Christophe, born of free parents on the island of St. Christopher, October 6, 1767, was taken into slavery as a boy. At 21, after obtaining his freedom by marrying his master's daughter, he became a waiter in a seaside hotel and soon was active in politics. When the revolution broke out in France, be joined the rebel leader in Haiti, Dessalines, and became a general. When Dessalines was killed, Christophe took command as &quot;presidente of the north.&quot; Christophe turned a bankrupt, listless country into a progressive, prosperous nation with rich world trade. But in the process he made the people virtual slaves. Such was the man's nature that once he ordered a company of soldiers to march off the ramparts of the Citadelle to impress a visiting dignitary. The soldiers fell seven hundred feet to the rocks below and were killed. On October 8, 1820, stricken with apoplexy, his army deserting, Christophe called his family and court together, and in their presence washed himself, donned clean clothing, then shot himself through the heart with a golden bullet which he always carried.  		1	2003-06-07 15:18:54	1	2003-08-19 07:56:13
544	Olive	4a	3	10	In order to learn to be one's true self, it is necessary to obtain a wide and extensive knowledge of what has been said and done in the world; critically to inquire into it; carefully to ponder over it; clearly to sift it; and earnestly to carry it out. It matters not what you learn, but when you once learn a thing, you must never give it up until you have mastered it. It matters not what you inquire into, but when you inquire into a thing, you must never give it up until you have thoroughly understood it. It matters not what you try to think out, but when you once try to think out a thing, you must never give it up until you have got what you want. It matters not what you try to sift out, but when you once try to sift out a thing, you must never give it up until you have sifted it out clearly and distinctly. It matters not what you try to carry out, but when you once try to carry out a thing, you must never give it up until you have done it thoroughly and well. If another man succeeds by one effort, you will use a hundred efforts. If another man succeeds by ten efforts, you will use a thousand efforts. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:54	1	2003-07-23 16:16:28
545	Olive	4a	4	10	Every year scientists open more doors that lead to the secrets of new beneficent drugs. There is bacitracin, which was discovered by two scientists at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. These two people, Dr. Frank Meleney and Miss Balbina Johnson, knowing that the human body had some kind of action in itself with which it fights infections, began to search for the chemical that does this. In the hospital they examined badly infected wounds of people who had been hurt in accidents and made tests of the blood and the infected tissue. Finally, in the wound of a girl who had broken a leg bone, they found the useful germs which seemed to be fighting the poisonous infection. They took some of these into the laboratory and from them developed cultures; that is, larger masses of the germs with which to experiment. At last, after long and painstaking work, they were able to draw from these germs a substance which is a germ destroyer. Dr. Meleney and Miss Johnson named it bacitracin  bad because the germ is, in scientific language, a bacillus and tracin for Margaret Tracy, whose broken leg supplied the germ. Bacitracin at first was used only locally; later the drug was developed into a solution that can be used to fight germs through the blood stream. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:54	1	2003-07-23 16:30:23
546	Olive	4a	5	10	In the islands of the Bismarck Archipelago, six times a year at the advent of the new moon, an impressive ceremony takes place. In the gray of the dawn the inhabitants of the village assemble on the beach. When the first streaks of pale pink appear on the horizon, a faint sound of singing and the beat of drums is heard. As the light grows brighter, six canoes lashed together and surmounted by a platform move slowly in from the sea. The apparitions on the platform, the Duk-duks, dance violently, uttering shrill cries like the yelpings of a puppy. The villagers receive- them fearfully. When the canoes touch the beach, the masked spirits jump onto shore. The natives fall back respectfully so as to avoid touching them. If one is touched even by accident, the masked visitor may tomahawk the unfortunate savage on the spot. After the Duk-duks have landed, the old men of the village conduct them to a secret house that has been built for them in the woods. For three weeks these awful visitors remain in the village, and at intervals the young men of the tribe are lined up and beaten by them with sticks until the blood flowsa ceremony which the youths must endure without protest. Meanwhile, piles of food have been collected and are offered to the Duk-duks, who carry them off. Unlike the usual initiation of youths, the ceremonial beating which the young men endure sometimes continues with the visits of the Duk-duks for as long as twenty years. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:55	1	2003-07-23 16:32:09
547	Olive	4a	6	10	Some have calculated that the world's population will by the year 2106 have reached 20 billion. Nature's explosive fecundity is as awesome as the power of the atom. A well-fed amoeba will double in an hour. Given adequate food and favorable circumstances, it could by the sixth day have produced enough amoebas to exceed the weight of the entire earth! One type of plant louse breeds so quickly that, if all its progeny survived, the lice would in ten generations weigh as much as 500 million stout men. If every codfish egg became adult and reproduced, within six years the Atlantic Ocean would be a solid mass of cod. Certain protozoa might, theoretically, fill all known space in a few years. Human beings cannot quite keep up but some try hard. The Hutterites of the U.S.A. and Canada have increased by some 19 times in the last 70 years. At the present rate, they would in 250 years more than equal the present population of the United States. The original 6,000 French settlers of Canada have multiplied no less than 700 times in a little over 300 years. Let present death rates sink furtheras it seems likely if mankind avoids a major atomic warand there seem to be no limits, except those of available food and other primary resources, to the number of people. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:55	1	2003-07-23 16:35:17
548	Olive	4a	7	10	The Eskimo dog, commanded by the Eskimo, is guided solely by voice and whip, the latter being from twelve to eighteen feet long. In the hands of the experienced dog runner) the whip becomes a marvelous instrument of precision. He can literally snap the tip of it on a dime. The Eskimo, unspoiled by white man's influence, is perhaps one of the most trusting and primitive of all Indians but seems to be indifferent to the welfare of his. animals. In this he's simply a product of his environment where food is hard to get, hunger is frequent, and the climate for nine months of the year is marked by bitter cold and a long stretch of darkness. In consequence, his dogs have to earn their keep and earn it the hard way. Rarely is a dog taken into the shelter of the family's home. His sleeping place, no matter how severe the weather, is a burrow in the snow! Rarely is the Eskimo dog permitted to wander. When his master is moved to travel, the dog has to be on hand to help pull whatever load is put on the sledge, and often such loads are very heavy. The Eskimo dog in his region is a tough, savage, quarrelsome animal with a hair-trigger temper. On his home ground he requires stern handlingand he gets it. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:55	1	2003-07-23 16:37:07

550	Olive	4a	9	10	What exactly is a tornado? The general picture is familiar enough. The phenomenon usually occurs on a hot) sticky day with south winds and an ominous sky. From the base of a thunderhead, a funnel-shaped cloud extends a violently twisting spout toward the earth. As it sucks in matter in its path, the twister may turn black, brown, or occasionally (over snow) even white. The moving cloud shows an almost continuous display of sheet lightning. It lurches along in a meandering path, usually northeastward, at 25 to 40 miles per hour. Sometimes it picks up its finger from the earth for a short distance and then plants it down again. The funnel is very slender: its wake of violence averages about 400 yards wide. As the tornado approaches, it is heralded by a roar as of hundreds of jet planes or thousands of railroad cars. Its path is a path of total destruction. Buildings literally explode as they are sucked in by the tornado's low-pressure vortex (where the pressure drop is as much as 10 per cent) and by its powerful whirling winds (estimated at up to 500 miles per hour). The tornado's lifetime is as brief as it is violent. Within a few tens of miles (average: about 16 miles), it spends its force and suddenly disappears. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:55	1	2003-07-23 16:40:52
551	Olive	4a	10	10	The old idea that child prodigies &quot;burn themselves out&quot; or &quot;overtax their brains&quot; in the early years and, therefore, are prey to failure and (at worst) mental illness is just so much myth. As a matter of fact, the outstanding thing that happens to bright kids is that they are very likely to grow into bright adults. To find this out, 1,500 gifted persons were followed up to their thirty-fifth year with these results: On adult intelligence tests, they scored as high as they had as children. They were, as a group, in good health, physically and mentally. Eighty-four per cent of their group were married and seemed content with their lives. About 70 per cent had graduated from college, though only 30 per cent had graduated with honors. A few had even flunked out, but nearly half of these had returned to graduate. Of the men, 80 per cent were in one of the professions or in business-executive or semiprofessional jobs. The women who had remained single had office, business, or professional occupations. The group had published 90 books and 1,500 articles in scientific, scholarly, and literary magazines and had collected more than 100 patents. In a material way they didn't do badly either. Average income was considerably higher among the gifted people, especially the men, than for the country as a whole, despite their comparative youth when last surveyed. In fact, far from being strange, maladjusted people locked in an ivory tower, most of the gifted were turning their early promise into practical reality. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:56	1	2003-07-23 16:42:46
552	Olive	4a	11	10	Why don't birds get lost on their long migratory flights? Scientists have puzzled over this question for many years. Now they're beginning to fill in the blanks. Not long ago, experiments showed that birds rely on the sun to guide them during daylight hours. But what about birds that fly mainly by night? Tests with artificial stars have proved conclusively that certain night-flying birds are able to follow the stars in their long-distance flights. One such birda warblerhad spent its lifetime in a cage and had never flown under a natural sky. Yet it showed an inborn ability to use the stars for guidance. The bird's cage was placed under an artificial star-filled sky at migration time. The bird tried to fly in the same direction as that taken by his outdoor cousins. Any change in the position of the make-believe stars caused a change in the direction of his flight. Scientists think that warblers, when flying in daylight, use the sun for guidance. But the stars are apparently their principal means of navigation. What do they do when the stars are hidden by clouds? Apparently, they find their way by such landmarks as mountain ranges, coast lines, and river courses. But when it's too dark to see these, the warblers circle helplessly, unable to get their bearings. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:56	1	2003-08-19 07:57:18
553	Olive	4a	12	10	That animals eat plants is well known; however, few people other than botanists know much about the remarkable plants that trap and consume live insects. Some of these plants are microscopic in size; the two smallest belong to a group of fungi called molds. One of the simple fungi resembles a twig with tiny lollipops sticking out along its sides. In fact, biologists call this variety the &quot;lethal lollipop.&quot; An unwary, tiny worm that wiggles against one of the small knobs becomes stuck fast, like a fly caught on flypaper. The more the worm wiggles, the tighter it sticks, as more and more of its body touches the sticky knob. The &quot;glue&quot; is an adhesive fluid secreted by the fungus. Soon after the fungus has trapped its victim, the knob inserts spearlike filaments into the worm's body. These filaments absorb and digest the nematode, leaving only an empty, wrinkled skin. A second killer fungus traps its victims in a sort of rabbit snare. One mold plant may have hundreds of loops attached to a long branch by short stalks. When the worm sticks its head inside a loop, it is doomed. Expanding cells tighten the loop, exerting a strangle hold that the struggling nematode cannot break. Soon the cells project spearlike prongs into the worm's body, killing and consuming it. All that is left is the worm's hollow skin. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:56	1	2003-07-23 16:47:57
554	Olive	4a	13	10	When W. C. Handy, composer of the &quot;St. Louis Blues,&quot; was thinking of a career, his minister father in Alabama told him: &quot;I'd rather follow you to the graveyard than see you become a musician.&quot; But the syncopation of life around him pounded harder in his ears than did his father's warning. He immersed himself in the Negro folk music of hunger and hilarity as he wandered over the South, working as a laborer and playing his trumpet in honky-tonk bands. Out of work in St. Louis) Handy slept on the river front and knew the winter cold after &quot;the evenin' sun&quot; went down. One night he heard two lovers quarreling. &quot;A redheaded woman done made a fool out of me,&quot; the man pleaded. He heard a woman sob: &quot;My man's got a heart like a rock cast into the sea.&quot; From such snatches of the Negro's rueful tragedies, he wrote more than sixty songs. Of all Handy's tunes, though, the greatest was born when he lifted his haunting memory into the &quot;St. Louis Blues.&quot; That was in 1914 and its tough poetic realism powerfully molded the new era of the blues. With the fabulous success of the &quot;St. Louis Blues,&quot; Handy founded his own publishing firm in New York and built the reputation that became the title of his autobiography and his epitaph: &quot;Father of the Blues.&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:56	1	2003-08-19 07:58:11

556	Olive	4a	15	10	What kind of human being will the future spaceman be? Will he need bones of steel and powerful muscles to resist rocket thrust, the lungs of a glass blower, a mighty heart, the aplomb of an acrobat, unconscious death urges, or a schizophrenic drive toward isolation? Popular ideas of a spaceman tend to be weird composites of comic-book fiction and fact. A more realistic portrait emerges from the young science of bioastronautics, the newest and strangest of medical disciplines. The astronaut may be described as a youngish man of high intelligence who is normal to an abnormal degree. On earth he may well have been a skin diver, high diver, tumbler, pole vaulter, or acrobat. He must be highly motivated, carefully trained  and he must want to come back. His heart and lungs must be healthy but need not be exceptionally developed, for his cabin will be pressurized. Huge muscles may actually be a handicap, for he will have almost no way to get exercise, and he will find that the strength of a year-old child is adequate in the weightlessness of space. A compact body and a short, sturdy neck will help him to withstand the tremendous forces encountered at take-off. Most important physically, his digestive system must be one that will not be upset by weightlessness; he must not be subject to motion sickness. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:57	1	2003-08-19 08:00:15

558	Olive	4a	17	10	Gossip can be gracious and kindly and as often affected by good will as by rancor. Try to imagine, for instance, a village where there is no gossip. Every citizen in it is, to use a common expression, minding his own business, never caring to see what anyone else is doing. In such a place, there would probably be no charities, no getting together, no luncheon clubs, no sewing bees, no Rotary, no Parent-Teacher Associations, and in fact, no local news, for news is nothing but verified gossip. News is verified gossip and history is verified newsverified in the unlimited passage of time, for this verification may take a few hours or a few thousand years. Scholars today are endlessly checking the legendary accounts of the victories of Genghis Khan or seeking to reconcile conflicting testimony as to the exact words of Jesus. For we know that a vast deal of unverified gossip slips into history's pages, to linger there for generations until the discovery of lost evidence brings us closer to the truth. It is inevitable that this should be so. Stories which are passed from father to son may be intentionally altered to suit the age or the taste of the listener, without intent to distort; or they may be told with accuracy, but inaccurately heard, and still more inaccurately repeated. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:57	1	2003-07-23 16:53:51
559	Olive	4a	18	10	All eyes turn to Ted Williams when he approaches the plate, for this is the master at work. Six feet, four inches high, his body is loose and relaxed as he enters the batter's box. His smooth, even warm-up swings seem to exude power. A left-handed batter, Williams has the added advantages of keen eyesight and an uncanny judgment in tracing the trajectory of a pitch. He usually outjudges the pitcher himself, as he gauges the speed and direction of the ball and has the capacity to make fine, accurate decisions as to whether a ball is in or outside the strike zone. A brilliant bitter, he is also a fervent student of pitchers and pitching. Williams' swing, timing, and follow-through are not accidents. He has worked hard to perfect his control, timing, and style. Practicing before a mirror, he overcame his batting weaknesses by facing up to pitches which gave him trouble. Practice makes perfect. With his average of one home run for every 17.72 times at bat, Ted Williams is one of the most feared sluggers in the game. Although Ted Williams' baseball skills diminish when he is out of the batting box, the majesty of a Ted Williams' home run is undeniable. His stance, timing, and swing, the crack of his bat as it meets the ball these add up to a virtuoso performance on the diamond. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:57	1	2003-08-19 08:02:05
560	Olive	4a	19	10	In self-imposed solitary confinement 22-year-old Tom Wonnacott, a Princeton graduate student, spent four days lying in a lightless, soundproofed isolation chamber. Unable to see or hear, he also wore thick gloves to restrict his sense of touch. Wonnacott was the forty-first volunteer to undergo this experience to help psychologists Jack Vernon and Thomas McGill find out what happens to people isolated from the outside world and deprived of the normal use of their senses. Tests like this, being performed in laboratories around the world, gave data on such uniquely modern problems as brainwashing and space flight. In his chamber, Wonnacott usually slept for only three or four hours at a time. He got up from his bed only to use his chemical toilet or eat from his food box. He had a hard time keeping himself mentally busy but was pleased at how easily he could remember poetry and do mathematical problems in his head. After the first 24 hours in isolation, though, he found his thinking getting somewhat muddled; and he wound up lacking muscle control and being abnormally swayed by suggestion. His senses also suffered in the dark of the cell. With only his taste and smell to guide him, he mistook beef bouillon for tomato soup, and bologna for ham. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:57	1	2003-07-23 16:56:51
561	Olive	4a	20	10	If the circus can be defined as &quot;an exhibition of skill and daring in an arena or an enclosed space,&quot; then the circus is almost as old as humanity itself. This was brought to light by Sir Arthur Evans, excavator of Cnossus on the island of Crete, who proved that circus-like feats were performed before crowds some 2,400 years before Christ. A wall painting found by Sir Arthur in a house at Cnossus supports his claim. The ancient stunt in which trained Cretan girls and youths took part was that of bull leaping and it must have required a tremendous amount of courage and skill, for it was a spectacular and dangerous performance. Bull leaping was staged circus-fashion in an arena before a crowd of onlookers who sat in elevated seats. In the arena stood the leapers, scantily clad and unarmed, waiting to meet the challenge of a wild bull. As an animal charged with head lowered, the nearest leaper would grasp its horns with his hands, and then in an amazing display of agility he would swing upwards and turn a complete somersault over the bull's back. Alighting, he would quickly turn about and catch the next leaper. One after another they would thus perform in a continuous sequence of dodging, leaping, and catching. In more than 4,000 years, few circus acts have ever bettered this very early example. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:58	1	2003-07-23 16:58:15

564	Blue	4a	3	11	In 1884 Lewis Edson Waterman carried on his watch chain a collapsible steel dip pen and a stoppered portable inkwell. This arrangement delighted no one but dry cleaners. Various so-called fountain pens, crude affairs with built-in ink reservoirs, had by this time appeared on the market and Waterman bought one. Soon afterward, as one of his prospects was about to sign an application for a large policy, Waterman tendered the fountain pen. The pen flooded the document, and Waterman's testy customer gave his business to a rival insurance agent. Sorely wounded in pocket and ego, Waterman quit life insurance and applied his natural mechanical talents to the invention of a practical fountain pen. It was easy enough to devise a built-in reservoir, but no pen had been invented that would deliver ink in a continuous flow, or controlled leak, starting and stopping as required by the writer. To insure steadiness in feed, Waterman decided to apply the principle of capillary attraction. He made a hair-thin fissure, or capillary channel, to lead ink to the pen point, plus another channel to admit air into the ink chamber so that internal air pressure was balanced. Capillary attraction  the phenomenon that makes a liquid ignore gravity when confined in narrow channels  keeps the ink from leaking out, except when the pen point is in contact with some object. Patented in 1884, Waterman's famous &quot;fissure feed&quot; pen worked so well that its principle of ink control is still used in all fountain pens except ball points. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:58	1	2003-08-19 07:45:50

566	Blue	4a	9	11	Every evening, some part of the British Commonwealth hears the chimes of Big Ben, largest of the bells in the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster. The tower is popularly called Big Ben, but it is the great bell which really is Big Ben. It is this bell which chimes out the quarter hours to the people of London. For Britons at sea or living in distant lands, the sound of Big Ben is still a link with home, for the chimes are broadcast each evening by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Big Ben has been chiming out the quarter hours now for just a century. It started chiming on June II, 1859. At that time, Parliament couldn't decide what to name the bell. A light-hearted member of Parliament called attention, in a speech, to the impressive hulk of Sir Benjamin Hall, Queen Victoria's Chief Lord of the Woods and Forests. &quot;Call it Big Ben,&quot; said the speaker, and the name stuck. Big Ben is 9 feet in diameter, 7 feet 6 inches tall, and the thickness where the hammer strikes is 8.75 inches. The clock that regulates the chiming of Big Ben keeps good time. In 1939, the Royal Astronomer made a 290-day check on the performance of the clock. He found that during this test the margin of error was less than two-tenths of a second in 24 hours on 93 days and greater than one second only on 16 of the 290 days. There was an unexpected lapse on August 12, 1945, and consternation swept through the Ministry of Works. On that dark day, the clock was five minutes slow. A flock of starlings had roosted on the minute hand. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:58	1	2003-07-23 18:13:59
567	Blue	4a	5	11	At Frobisher, &quot;capital&quot; of Baffin Island, where the airfield built by the United States in World War II and later purchased by Canada is being expanded, Eskimos are in jet-propelled transition from the Stone Age to alarm clocks, Western movies, and hi-fi. In tents on the stone beach littered with ice brought in by the tide, Eskimo men rise from piles of animal skins to work at the American radar station or on jobs at the harbor or airfield. Breakfast may be taken from a tub of raw seal meat or fish, or it may be a box of cereal, coffee, toast, and eggs (which are $1.45 a dozen). Eskimos wear store clothes from the trading post or mail-order catalogue, native dress of hides chewed soft by the women, or a surprising mixture. American Air Force caps are popular. Long cigarette holders are used to smoke through parka hoods trimmed with wolf fur. For the first time in their lives, Frobisher Eskimo children are going to school. Few know any English, which is taught to the children by teachers who know no Eskimo. The Eskimo children are more attentive and learn faster than white children starting school. A teacher said this may be because &quot;their heads are uncluttered.&quot; Throughout the Arctic, white employers praise the Eskimo for his happy disposition, muscular co-ordination, and quickness to learn mechanical skills. They find fault, however, with his instinct to turn his back on regular hours and wages to go hunting or fishing when he feels like it. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:59	1	2003-08-04 16:52:44
568	Blue	4a	6	11	&quot;20th. This day on board the Peacock we witnessed a sea fight between a whale and one of its many enemies. The sea was quite smooth and offered the best possible view of the whole combat. First, at a distance from the ship, a whale was seen floundering in a most extraordinary way, lashing the smooth sea into a perfect foam and endeavoring, apparently, to extricate himself from some annoyance. As he approached the ship, the struggle continuing and becoming more violent, it was perceived that a fish, apparently about twenty feet long, held him by the jaw  his contortions, spouting, and throes all betokening the agony of the huge monster. The whale now threw himself at full length from the water with open mouth, his pursuer still hanging to the jaw, the blood issuing from the wound and dyeing the sea to a distance around. But all his flounderings were of no avail; his pertinacious enemy still maintained his hold and was evidently getting the advantage of him. &quot;These 'killers,' as they are called, are of a brownish color on the back and white on the belly, with a long dorsal fin. Such was the turbulence with which they passed that a good view could not be had of them to make out more nearly the description. The 'killers' attack a whale in the same way as dogs bait a bull and worry him to death. They are armed with strong, sharp teeth and generally seize the whale by the lower jaw.&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:59	1	2003-08-19 07:47:19

570	Blue	4a	7	11	Are you superstitious? No, of course not. Do you believe in magic, and luck charms, and elves or gremlins? Certainly not, but if I should greet you with the usual &quot;How's business?&quot; you'll answer &quot;Oh, just so-so.&quot; Yet your health is the best it's ever been and your business is booming. Or, when you are successful in some venture and you are complimented, you knock on wood and say you were just lucky; yet you know it was probably due to your ability and hard work. Why? Playing down good health and making light of good fortune stems from a desire to avoid the envy and enmity of the gods who may be listening in. So you duck, attribute your success to luck, or knock on wood. And you knock on wood because wood was once a tree and there is a primitive belief that protective gods inhabit trees and knocking on wood attracts their attention so they may be credited with your successes. If I should sneeze, only the strongest of you could refrain from saying &quot;God bless you.&quot; Why bless this unsanitary rudeness? Our ancestors believed that a sneeze opened the body to invasion by devils, and invoking the name of God made the devils get out in a hurry. You may not realize it, but you express this same &quot;devil invasion&quot; when you say: &quot;That youngster acts possessed&quot; or &quot;Whatever can have gotten into that child?&quot; or &quot;I wonder what possessed me to do that?&quot; Although they may no longer be believed, evidences of superstitions that have had their origins in the primitive fear of the unknown still exist in modern language and gestures. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:59	1	2003-08-19 07:49:30
571	Blue	4a	10	11	At the bottom of the world lies a mighty continent still wrapped in the Ice Age and, until recent times, unknown to man. It is a great land mass criss crossed by mountain ranges whose extent and elevation are still uncertain. Much of the continent is a complete blank on our maps. A 1,000-mile stretch of the coastline has never been reached by any ship. Man has explored, on foot, less than one per cent of its area. Antarctica differs fundamentally from the arctic regions. The Arctic is an ocean, covered with drifting packed ice and hemmed in by the land masses of Europe, Asia, and North America. The Antarctic is a continent almost as large as Europe and Australia combined, centered roughly on the South Pole and surrounded by the most unobstructed water areas of the world  the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. The continental ice sheet is more than two miles high in its center; thus, the air over the Antarctic is far more refrigerated than it is over the Arctic regions. This cold air cascades off the land with such force that it makes the nearby seas the stormiest in the world and renders unliveable those regions whose counterparts at the opposite end of the globe are inhabited. Thus, more than a million persons live within 2,000 miles of the North Pole in an area that includes most of Alaska, Siberia, and Scandinavia  a region rich in forest and mining industries. Apart from a handful of weather stations, within the same distance of the South Pole there is not a single tree, industry, or settlement. 		1	2003-06-07 15:18:59	1	2003-07-23 18:16:13
572	Blue	4a	11	11	In 1960, the salt density of Great Salt Lake in Utah ranged between twenty and twenty-five per cent. The Dead Sea is the only body of water saltier than Great Salt Lake, and both are saltier than the oceans. In cold weather, some of the less soluble salts precipitate out since water's saturation point lowers with the temperature. Bars of almost pure sodium sulfate have piled up across the shallows in much the same fashion as silt or sand. More graphically, the water is about one-fourth salt by weight. Imagine taking two quarts of water, boiling it, and obtaining a pound of loose, coarse salt. Commercial salt companies along the shore take tons of salt which are refined in the basin every year. Yet an estimated six and one-half billion tons of salt remain in the water  enough to supply the world's needs for generations. The water is actually so dense that the incoming flow from streams floats in sheets for miles out from their mouths, only gradually sinking and mixing with the brine. This layer of fresh water may freeze over in the winter and permit the passage of wildlife from mainland to islands, or the, buffeting wind may pile the fresh water into icebergs which float ludicrously around in the sub-zero brine. Boats in the lake get heavy coatings of sulfate on the rear of their propeller blades where the reduced pressure has caused the salts to precipitate. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:00	1	2003-07-23 18:20:28
573	Blue	4a	12	11	In the very early days of the automobile, a driver had to be a stouthearted fellow who cared little for the opinions of his neighbors or for his own fate. That, at least, was the case in some sections of Pennsylvania. A Clymer motor scrapbook in the central public library's collection of material on automobiles tells of &quot;rules&quot; and aims of the Farmer's Anti-Automobile Society in Pennsylvania. On Sundays, for instance, the rural auto haters were urged to &quot;chase automobiles, shouting and shooting at drivers, and threatening them with arrest.&quot; Those were the days, of course, when there were far more horses than cars and the animals often got skittish in the presence of their rivals. One rule of the society stated that if a horse refused to pass a car on the road, &quot;the driver of the car must take the machine apart as rapidly as possible and conceal the parts in the bushes.&quot; Two other rules were:
1  &quot;Automobiles traveling on country roads at night must send up a rocket every mile, then wait ten minutes for the road to clear. The driver may then proceed with caution, blowing his horn and shooting off Roman candles as before.&quot;
2  &quot;If the driver of an automobile sees a team of horses approaching, he is to stop, pull over to the side of the road, and cover his machine with a blanket or dust cover which is painted or colored to blend into the scenery and thus render the machine less noticeable.&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:00	1	2003-07-23 18:23:45
574	Blue	4a	13	11	In submarines, the crewman who lets up for just a split second flirts with death. As skipper of the conventionally powered Stickleback, Lt. Commander Q. R. Schulz kept his ship taut by the sort of incessant drilling that had the crew responding like automatons to every conceivable emergency  all imaginary. Nineteen miles southwest of Pearl Harbor, the Stickleback made a simulated attack on the speeding destroyer-escort Silverstein and sounded the dive signal to evade the Silverstein's counterattack, also simulated, Just below the surface, the Stickleback unaccountably lost power and began to rise. Her periscope cut the surface in the path of the destroyer. The Silverstein, by this time too close and going too fast to prevent it, sliced into the submarine's port side. In the control room, the sea poured through a ruptured bulkhead. With the water up to his knees and rising swiftly, Chief Electrician's Mate Larry Hughes simply put his men through a drill Schulz had made them do time and time before. In 4 minutes, the 8 officers and 84 men of the Stickleback moved quickly but calmly from the sinking sub to the destroyer, which had kept her bow pressed into the hole in the submarine to partially plug the gap. True to tradition Schulz was the last man off. Five hours later the $10 million Stickleback sank in 9,000 feet of water. No one was lost; no one was injured. &quot;A miracle,&quot; said the commander of the Stickleback's sub squadron. &quot;No panic,&quot; said a crew member. &quot;It was just like the drills.&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:00	1	2003-08-19 07:52:09
575	Blue	4a	14	11	We of today get most of our impressions of the Old West from books, from movies, and from old yarns handed down by word of mouth. Is it any wonder that we often get a pretty poor picture of the old six- gun days? A few books and articles, such as Stuart N. Lake's biography of Wyatt Earp and articles by Ed McGivern, Elmer Keith, &quot;Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald, Major Hatcher, and a few others, are accurate and show an intimate knowledge of the capabilities and limitations of the six-gun. These writers give the old-timers the great credit they deserve without cheapening them with the cloak of questionable glamour and a long list of utterly impossible shooting feats. The same cannot be said of many writers of popular fiction, semi-historical books, and movie scenarios. As to word-of-mouth yarns, the average person loves a good story so well that he tries to outdo the one who told the tale to him. Often the true facts are lost in a colorful haze of imagination. Few people can read one of the good Western novels without keen enjoyment; yet anyone who knows the West realizes that cowboys spend long, lonely months on the range working cattle and are not continuously riding into town dressed in fancy trappings worth a couple of years' wages and performing marvelous shooting stunts with a six-shooter. A cowboy's life is far from the exciting round of pleasure and thrills depicted in most Western stories and pictures. These tales are thrilling fables. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:00	1	2003-07-23 18:27:27
576	Blue	4a	15	11	First, of course, it is plain that in the year 2000 everyone will have at his elbow several times more mechanical energy than he has today. Second, there will be advances in biological knowledge as far-reaching as those that have been made in physics. We are only beginning to learn that we can control our biological environment as well as our physical one. Starvation has been prophesied twice to a growing world population: by Malthus about 1800, by Crookes about 1900. It was headed off the first time by taking agriculture to America and the second time by using the new fertilizers. In the year 2000, starvation will be headed off by the control of the diseases and the heredity of plants and animals  by shaping our own biological environment. And third, I come back to the haunting theme of automation. The most common species in the factory today is the man who works or minds a simple machine  the operator. By the year 2000, he will be as extinct as the hand-loom weaver and the dodo. The repetitive tasks of industry will be taken over by the machines, as the heavy tasks were taken over long ago; and the mental tedium will go the way of physical exhaustion. Today we still distinguish, even among repetitive jobs, between the skilled and the unskilled; but in the year 2000 all repetition will be unskilled. We simply waste our time if we oppose this change; it is as inevitable as the year 2000 itself. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:00	1	2003-07-23 18:28:56

578	Blue	4a	17	11	Not long ago, the research laboratory of a leading manufacturer produced a garment made completely from a liquid raw material. The garment, which had been sprayed on a form, was fibrous, flexible, and economical. It was presented as a potential throwaway item  one cheaper to replace than to launder. The manufacture of clothing depends less each year on the products of nature. The names of some of the synthetic fabrics are rapidly passing into the popular speech without public appreciation that they are registered trade names. The word rayon is so familiar that most consumers probably fail to realize that it identifies a man-made fabric, the result of the chemist's work with nature's cellulose. The products of research combine with natural fibers in fabrics that preserve the good qualities of both types and enhance the usefulness, performance, and appearance of the combinations. If progress continues, the materials used in clothing will not involve the man-hours of labor traditional in the industry. The machines that make cloth operate today at speeds unheard of when the manufacturing city of Lowell was in its heyday, and the machines can produce better, more attractive, and far more diverse fabrics. The mass markets for garments in any price range can be accommodated with ease because engineering development of textile machinery has progressed so far. Competitive developments in the field  not the least of which is the nonwoven, &quot;sprayed on&quot; garment  imply further drastic change. Presumably, the only area science will not have the temerity to attack is that of style. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:01	1	2003-07-23 18:30:29
579	Blue	4a	18	11	The &quot;balance of nature&quot; is not an empty phrase. Nature provides a population to occupy a suitable environment and cuts down surplus population to fit the available food supply. One means of reducing surplus population is predators; others are parasites and diseases. Also, population density produces nervous disorders and even drives animals to mass migrations, like the lemmings of Norway who plunge into the sea. That predator populations mount to control other animals has long been known. Many years ago, the Hudson's Bay Company records revealed that the fox population went up and down about a year after the rabbit population had gone up and down. Sometimes a situation occurs in which the predator population is reduced to a level below that which nature can readily replace. On Valcour Island in Lake Champlain (New York), a costly campaign resulted in the elimination of predatory animals only to have birds and small animals (including grouse and hares, popular game) increase for four years afterward. Then, lacking predator control, nature resorted to disease to cut down these populations. Jamaica had an example of nature's persistence in providing animals for existing habitat. Sugar planters, about 75 years ago, imported mongooses to control rats. The mongooses killed off the rats and, with plentiful food, multiplied. Rats became scarce and the mongooses ate poultry, lambs, kids, kittens, puppies, and wildlife. Eventually, food became scarce and the mongoose population declined. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:01	1	2003-07-23 18:32:29
580	Blue	4a	19	11	Giving weathermen a view of hurricanes, typhoons, and bigger-scale cloud formations from an observation post some 200 to 1,500 miles high  that's the job of our first earth satellite that &quot;sees.&quot; The two-eyed orbiter, officially called the &quot;cloud cover satellite,&quot; has been nicknamed the Weatherbird by its designers. It was predicted that the Weatherbird, during its batteries' life of about two weeks, would permit the most accurate weather forecasts ever made, for clouds are the telltale signs of great air movements that make the weather. A pioneering kind of television satellite, the Weatherbird itself serves as a TV camera, taking advantage of its own motions to scan the earth in TV style. A photocell in each telescopic eye peers at a small area of the earth and gauges its brightness. Meanwhile, the &quot;moon&quot; spins, once a second, sweeping the eye over a curved strip of the earth. The eye scans adjacent strips (with a slight overlap) as the &quot;moon&quot; orbits, building up a TV picture that is taped, radioed to earth, taped again, and finally transmitted to film for viewing. What results from each orbit is a photograph of the vast belt of cloudspotted earth, roughly 12,500 miles longthe world's sunlit halfand up to some 2,500 miles wide at the maximum range of coverage. Successive orbits picture most of the world. Under ideal conditions, Weatherbird's eyes are sharp enough to distinguish a natural feature only six miles square, smaller than the islands of Nantucket, St. Helena, or Saipan. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:01	1	2003-07-23 18:33:54
581	Blue	4a	20	11	The man wound up the clock work: The disk revolved; he lowered the needle of the sound box into the grooved surface. More than a hundred years before, Beethoven, stone deaf, had heard the imaginary music of stringed instruments expressing his inmost thoughts and feelings. He had made signs with ink on ruled paper. A century later four Hungarians had reproduced from the printed reproductions of Beethoven's scribbles that music which Beethoven had never heard except in his imagination. Spiral grooves on a surface of shellac remembered their playing. The artificial memory revolved, a needle traveled in its grooves, and through a faint scratching and roaring that mimicked the noises of Beethoven's own deafness, the audible symbols of Beethoven's convictions and emotions quivered out into the air. It was an unimpassioned music, transparent, pure, and crystalline, like a tropical sea, an Alpine lake. Water on water, calm sliding over calm; the according of level horizons and waveless expanses, a counterpoint of serenities. And everything clear and bright; no mists, no vague twilights. It was the calm of still and rapturous contemplation, not of drowsiness or sleep. It was the serenity of the convalescent who wakes from fever and finds himself born again into a realm of beauty. But the fever was &quot;the fever called living&quot; and the rebirth was not into this world; the beauty was unearthly, the convalescent serenity was the peace of Cod. The interweaving of Lydian melodies was heaven. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:01	1	2003-08-19 07:53:18

587	Red	4a	6	12	Our quarrel with efficiency is not that it gets things done, but that it is a thief of time when it leaves us no leisure to enjoy ourselves, and that it frays our nerves when we try to get things done perfectly. In building bridges, American engineers calculate so finely and exactly as to make the two ends come together within one-tenth of an inch. But when two Chinese begin to dig a tunnel from both sides of a mountain, both come out on the other side. The Chinese's firm conviction is that it doesn't matter so long as a tunnel is dug through, and if we have two instead of one, why, we have a double track to boot. The tempo of modern industrial life forbids this kind of glorious and magnificent idling. But, worse than that, it imposes upon us a different conception of time as measured by the clock and eventually turns the human being into a clock himself. ( This sort of thing is bound to come to China, as is evident, for instance, in the case of a factory of twenty thousand workers. The luxurious prospect of twenty thousand workers coming in at their own sweet pleasure at all hours is, of course, somewhat terrifying.) Nevertheless, such efficiency is what makes life so hard and hectic. A man who has to be punctually at a certain place at five o'clock has the whole afternoon from one to five ruined for him already. Every American adult is arranging his time on the pattern of the schoolboy  three o'clock for this, five o'clock for that, six-thirty for change of dress, six-fifty for entering the taxi, and seven o'clock for arriving at the destination. It just makes life not worth living. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:02	1	2003-07-23 18:47:24
588	Red	4a	7	12	Security and commodity exchanges are trading posts where people meet who wish to buy or sell. The exchanges themselves do no trading; they merely provide a place where prospective buyers and sellers can meet and conduct their business. Wall Street, although the best known, is not the only home of exchanges in the United States. There are the cotton exchanges in New Orleans and Chicago; the Mercantile Exchange, which deals in many farm products, in Chicago; and grain exchanges in many of the large cities of the Midwest. Some exchanges, like the Chicago Board of Trade, provide market services for several kinds of products. These trading posts where products may be bought or sold are called commodity exchanges. The security exchanges, on the other hand, are meeting places where stocks and bonds are traded. Like the commodity exchanges, they help serve the economic life of the country. But when their operations get out of hand, they may become very dangerous. In 1929, the security exchanges, or stock market, contributed to a crash  a sudden, sharp decline in the value of securities. Many people lost fortunes; many corporations were bankrupted; many workers lost their jobs. The Crash of 1929 has been attributed to many causes, among them wild and unwise speculation by many people and dishonest practices on the part of some businessmen and of some members of the exchanges. Today, however, investing through security exchanges and trading on commodity exchanges has been made safer by regulations set up by the exchanges themselves and by regulations of the United States government. In 1922, the government instituted the Commodity Exchange Commission which operates through the Department of Agriculture; and in 1934, the Securities and Exchange Commission, to protect investors and the public against dishonest practices on the exchanges. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:02	1	2003-07-23 18:48:50

590	Red	4a	9	12	The heritage of English law brought with it the seeds of American liberty  not the flower and the fruit, which were to be produced after long labor and painful struggle. Nevertheless, the seeds were there and they sprouted, took root, and have continued to grow. To this extent, the inheritance was valuable, but it is not to be denied that even though English law gave us the seeds of liberty, it also inflicted upon us a vast amount of useless lumber that we have not swept away entirely  after three hundred years of unremitting effort. Even the system of trial by jury, in spite of its enormous value, came to us with burdensome, outworn ideas and unnecessary precautions, on the one hand, and-with no adequate means of adaptation to changing conditions, on the other. For one thing, in the early days it was assumed that ignorance of the facts was a guarantee of a juror's impartiality. At that time, when means of communication were few and slow, there was something to be said for the idea; but today, when literacy is almost universal and means of communication abundant and almost instantaneous, ignorance of the facts is evidence, not of impartiality, but of extraordinary stupidity, or of extraordinary, indifference, neither of which is proof that a juror is, in fact, a peer of the man on trial. The rule that a juror must be ignorant of the facts is, therefore, a rule that operates against, not for, the effort to fill the jury box with h6nest men of ordinary intelligence. It has become so hopeless, indeed, that the courts literally ceased long ago trying to enforce it. It is, nevertheless, still a theoretical part of the system. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:03	1	2003-07-23 18:52:40
591	Red	4a	10	12	All data on levitation (the raising of and the floating of a body in the air) falls into two basic classes: the factual and the fanciful. But stories of levitations are so numerous and 
widespread and have persisted over so many centuries that one may safely presume a proportion of truth even though the proportion cannot be measured. That being so, the data may be classified as of three kinds. First, there are spontaneous levitations. Second, there are controlled levitations of people and objects by those who have, or claim to have, the ability to use the natural force involved. Third, there are self-levitations by adepts. An example of this last type, as well authenticated as anything in Holy Writ, is the case of the flying monk, St. Joseph of Copertino ( 1630-1663 ). He had the ability to work himself into such a transport of religious ecstasy that he would make a leap for heaven without bothering to consider whether God was ready for him. He swooped and soared so many times that his superiors grounded him by keeping him away from the certain ceremonies and processions that incited his displays of acrobatics. Even at the end, he floated from under the hands of a surgeon, Francesco Pierpaoli, and came down only when reproved by a witness, Father Silvestro Evangeliste. In more modern times, ballet fans and critics often asserted that there was something levitational about the remarkable jumps of the great dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, whose jumps took longer than it seemed they should. Nijinsky would soar from the stage and appear to remain suspended at peak for a few moments before coming down. When asked how it was done, he merely smiled and said, &quot;I just go up and pause there a little.&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:03	1	2003-08-19 08:27:06
592	Red	4a	11	12	An unidentified wit once said, &quot;Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Snore, and you sleep alone.&quot; Yet snoring is far from a laughing matter, as those unfortunates with good hearing, who are nightly subjected to the sounds of the snoring disorder, will testify. It has been estimated that one out of eight Americans snores; this means that there are approximately 21 million people  women as well as men  who render sonorous, nocturnal cantatas when they are asleep. And, assuming that each snorer disturbs the sleep of at least one other person, it necessarily follows that there are 21 million unhappy listeners. While a sleeping person breathes, either in or out, several structures in his nose and throat generate snoring. The sounds, coming from the soft palate and other soft structures of the throat, are caused by vibratory responses to inflowing and outflowing air. When the soft tissues of the mouth and throat come close to the lining of the throat, the vibrations that occur are caused by the position of the tongue. In short, the noise made by snoring can be compared to the noise made when breezes flutter a flag on a pole. The frequency of the vibrations depends on the size, density, and elasticity of the affected tissues and on the force of the air flow. Although it is usually the process of inhaling or exhaling through the mouth that causes snoring, short snores (commonly called snorts) come from the nose of an open-mouthed sleeper. In all fairness to snorers, however, it should be emphasized that snoring is an involuntary act which stops as soon as the offender is awakened. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:03	1	2005-02-04 17:32:39
593	Red	4a	12	12	Battles are like marriages. They have a certain fundamental experience they share in common; they differ infinitely, but still they are all alike. A battle seems to me a conflict of wills to the death in the same way that a marriage of love is the identification of two human beings to the end of the creation of life  as death is the reverse of life, and love of hate. Battles are commitments to cause death as marriages are commitments to create life. Whether, for any individual, either union results in death or in the creation of new life, each risks it  and in the risk commits himself. As the servants of death, battles will always remain horrible. Those who are fascinated by them are being fascinated by death. There is no-battle aim worthy of the name except that of ending all battles. Any other conception is, literally, suicidal. The fascist worship of battle is a suicidal drive; it is love of death instead of life. In the same idiom, to triumph in battle over the forces which are fighting for death is  again literally  to triumph over death. It is a surgeon's triumph as he cuts a body and bloodies his hands in removing a cancer in order to triumph over the death that is in the body. In these thoughts I have found my own peace, and I return to an army that fights death and cynicism in the name of life and hope. It is a good army. Believe in it. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:03	1	2003-07-24 15:44:07
594	Red	4a	13	12	In honor of a distinguished London bear, the Boroughport bear is named Tom 0' Lincoln. On certain Sundays and Thursdays, Tom 0' Lincoln is led out to a field beyond the gates where a ring has been surrounded by a barrier of solid stakes, outside of which are rude benches for the people of worship, and green turf for the multitude. The bear is fastened in the center of the ring by a collar and a thick rope some five yards long  tied to a stake in such manner that it can circulate freely. When all is set, the dogs are turned in  mastiffs with short noses &quot;that their teeth may get a better hold.&quot; The dogs, four or five at a time, creep up upon the bear while he writhes and tugs this way and that, more and more furious, and his eyes change to balls of pinkish fire. The betting among the onlookers grows reckless. Then a brave mastiff shoots in to seize Tom's muzzle. At once, Tom catches the creature in a mortal hug that squeezes the life out of him; but while Tom is thus occupied, the whole pack flies at him; instantly, nothing is visible but a swirling mass of animals, citing, clawing, roaring, tossing, and tumbling.&quot; The bear suddenly emerges, covered with blood and saliva, and drives back the surviving dogs with great bats of his paws. A second mastiff lies motionless; the others retreat to bark at a safe distance. Attendants rush in, drag away the fallen, and lead forward fresh dogs. The contest thus continues until Tom is so exhausted that another attack may kill him (an expensive business for the town) or until so many fine dogs have been slain or maimed that further bloody work is also too costly. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:04	1	2003-07-24 15:51:47
595	Red	4a	14	12	From deity-cluttered mythology to symbol-laden psychoanalysis, the snake has filled the human mind with fascination and revulsion. Its legends have become the substance of horror and humor that have beclouded the work  often valorous  of herpetologists. To try to remedy the confusion of the public, James A. Oliver, genial curator of reptiles at the Bronx Zoo, who seems to regard snakes as fellow Rotarians, has written a lucid, understandable book in which drama is not spoiled by hysteria and humor is highlighted by simplicity. In remarkably brief space, he has dissipated much of the nonsense about snakes and has distilled a good deal of the proven fact. Quite often, as is often the case in science, the truth is more interesting than fabrication. According to Mr. Oliver, no snake can crawl as fast as a man can run, and relatively few snakes are dangerous to man. As for snake charmers, Mr. Oliver exposes their tricks, pointing out that not even the Hopi Indian rain dancers are above pulling the fangs out of the rattlers used in their rites. As well as dissipating tall tales, Mr. Oliver offers a multitude of adventures about the pursuit of snakes in jungles, caves, and swamps. The stories in his book range from a scientist who was fatally bitten during a snake experiment to a snail-eating snake at the Bronx Zoo that became so pampered it wanted its snails shelled before it would eat them. True to the nature of herpetologists, Mr. Oliver finds the hostility of mankind toward snakes quite gruesome. &quot;Snakes,&quot; he complains, &quot;have been persecuted beyond all reason.&quot; With a few more books of this sort, the persecution may diminish. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:04	1	2003-08-19 08:28:36
596	Red	4a	15	12	The old-time demeanor of children differs as much from the carriage of children today as the severe and arbitrary disciplinary modes of colonial days differ from the persuasive explanations, the moral inculcations and exhortations, by which modern youth are taught obedience. Long ago, parents, teachers, and ministers believed that the only cures for the &quot;foolishness bound up in the heart of a child&quot; were stem repression and sharp correction. In the colonial schools, many ingenious punishments were invented. An especially insulting one was to send the pupil out to cut off a small branch from a tree. The teacher made a split at the severed end of the branch, and the culprit's nose was placed in the cleft end. Then he was forced to stand, painfully pinched, an object of ridicule. A familiar punishment of the same school, which lingered until our own day, was the smart tapping of the child's head with a heavy thimble; this was known as &quot;thimell-pie.&quot; Another was to yoke two delinquents together in a device made with two bows like an ox yoke. Sometimes a boy and a girl were yoked together  a terrible disgrace. &quot;Whispering sticks&quot; were used to preserve quiet in the schoolroom. These were wooden gags which were placed in the mouth and tied with strings, in a way similar to placing a bit in a horse's mouth. Children were punished by being seated upon a unipod, a stool with but a single leg, upon which it was most tiring to try to balance; they were made to stand on dunce stools and to wear dunce caps and heavy leather spectacles; they were labeled with large placards marked with degrading or ridiculous names such as &quot;Tell-Tale,&quot; &quot;Bite-Finger-Baby,&quot; &quot;Lying Ananias,&quot; &quot;Idle-Boy,&quot; and &quot;Pert-Miss-Prat-a-Pace.&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:04	1	2003-08-19 08:30:44

598	Red	4a	17	12	The human volunteer is a man who is in greater and greater demand in these days of expanded scientific research. For the time comes, despite all laboratory work, all the experiments with animals, and all the microscopic analyses, when only a human being can provide the true test. Today, the human volunteer may fall into one of three broad groupings: military men, prisoners, and volunteers whose religious or other convictions lead them to such work. Among these men and women you will find those who will take shots of the new vaccines, who will swallow radioactive drugs, who will fly higher than anyone else, who will watch malaria-infected mosquitoes feed on their bare arms, who will eat nothing but rice for six weeks, and who will permit themselves to be locked alone in chambers too small to stretch their legs. Why do human guinea pigs volunteer? Some may be seeking adventure; others, recognition; but most are moved by religious convictions or a strong sense of scientific dedication. Studies by psychiatrists of several groups of volunteers have shown that, in addition to these reasons, some have been motivated by the desire to avoid unpleasant situations at home or to hold off making decisions on their future careers, while still others volunteered because, unconsciously, they felt guilty of something they had done or thought they had done and wanted to atone for it. One study made of 29 volunteers also indicated that there was some emotional disturbance in 15 of them, ranging from personality disorders to neurotic reactions. Is there a little of the volunteer in all of us? Maybe. The polls report that more than five million Americans are willing to take the first flight to the moon. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:04	1	2003-07-24 15:56:41

600	Red	4a	19	12	The kind of music, song, and dance a people generates, with its characteristic rhythm and beat, forms one of the best indexes of its cultural style; and in America, the dominant musical styles are blues, swing, and jazz. The lyrics to this music are often mawkish and sometimes nonsensical, but frequently they embody a wild and earthy humor, or a sad and tragic strain. As distinguished from most American popular tunes, American hot music is not written to be danced to. Yet there is an internal beat in jazz which relates it deeply to dance: the movements of the body interpret the music's intent better than words can. When there is dancing, however, the dances break away from a formal pattern and, at their best, take on a fluid, improvised character in keeping with the improvisations of the music. Unlike earlier American folk dances, which are collective, so-called ballroom dancing is performed by couples. Each couple is comparatively alone, not being well enough acquainted with the other couples on the dance floor to join them. But, in the more adept swing dancing, as the music mounts the partners separate to execute complicated solo variations and then rejoin each other. At the same time, the musicians vie with each other in their improvisations, and, as the jam session approaches one of its climaxes, the dancers pay the musicians the tribute of gathering around to cheer them on. In the organic fusion of popular dance and music, Americans come closer to reaching mass exaltation and a native idiom of religious feeling than they do in any other aspect of their lives. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:05	1	2003-07-24 15:58:02
601	Red	4a	20	12	On the very eve of the twentieth century, America received its first glimpse of a fabulous book  Sears, Roebuck's first big annual catalog. For decades to come, it was to be the most familiar, most widely read, and, in certain materialistic respects, the most civilizing publication in the country's rural history. The policies expressed in the catalog, its physical composition, and, above all, its truly imperial prose style were largely the work of the company's founder, Richard Sears. Sears called his book a Consumers Guide, and wasting no time, told his readers on the front cover: &quot;This book tells just what your storekeeper at home pays for everything he buys, and will prevent him from overcharging you on anything you buy from him.&quot; The bitter obscenities which greeted this pious crack in many a crossroad's general store are still ringing down the years. After delivering this body blow to local enterprise, Sears went on to smooch up the distant individual customer. His early policy of &quot;send no money&quot; was followed by one of &quot;satisfaction guaranteed.&quot; The switcheroo was that Sears meant it  and not only meant it, but backed it up. Even more to the point, Sears had a canny insight into certain shynesses of the unschooled back-country citizens who needed him almost as much as he needed them. &quot;Don't be afraid that you will make a mistake in ordering,&quot; he reassured them in his best crooning style. &quot;Tell us what you want in your own way, written in any language, no matter whether good or poor writing, and the goods will promptly be sent to you.&quot; They heard him, they wrote him, and the goods were sent  carload after carload after carload. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:05	1	2003-07-24 15:59:24
602	Tan	4a	1	13	In 1885 Owen Wister (1850-1938) recorded that &quot;it won't be a century before the West is simply the true America, with thought, type, and life of its own&quot; and he wanted &quot;to be the hand that once, for all, chronicled and laid bare the virtues and the vices of this extraordinary phase of American social progress.&quot; He never became that self-envisioned Tolstoi of the old West, but in 1902 The Virginian was published. It won instant success and skyrocketed its author to fame. It is still the most popular &quot;Western&quot; novel ever published and the master design for the fiction of the Wild West. The Virginian established a literary form, a formula popularly known as &quot;horse opera,&quot; whose conventions, cliches, and values have reappeared in novels and short stories, in movies and television serials, ever since. The romantic cowboy is the hero and gentleman, one of those &quot;good men in the humbler walks of life,&quot; who sees through shams, defends justice and a lady's honor, shoots it out with the villain, and conquers evil. Because of The Virginian, Wister created a character who is the original type for the Western folk hero. He represents the embodiment of certain American ideals  a man who is equal to all occasions, who shows independence of action, a man who keeps his word and who is &quot;a broad-gauge fellow living among narrow-gauge folk.&quot; But the literary device and cowboy code which Wister established dictated that the hero must kill the bad man. This necessity for sanctioning murder and the romanticizing of the cowboy as a gentleman prohibited The Virginian and the genre it created from becoming serious fiction, or even an authentic product of the western experience. Instead of achieving his ambition, therefore, Wister gave us a sort of American folk epic, the cowboy story. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:05	1	2003-07-24 16:09:32
603	Tan	4a	2	13	On her first day in Wichita, Carry Nation entered the Hotel Carey bar, the most elegant joint in all Kansas. She was fairly blinded by its brilliance, but not quite, and her beady, black eyes did not miss an enormous oil painting, Cleopatra at the Bath, on one wall. She stopped dead in her tracks. She returned to her own hotel, to muse on the Hotel Carey bar  &quot;that hell, glittering with crystallized tears&quot;  and to take from her valise a short iron bar. This she bound with stout cord to her husband's cane and, hiding the formidable weapon beneath her cape, returned to the Hotel Carey, pausing in an alley to pick up a fair load of stones, which she wrapped in a newspaper. Now she was ready for Cleopatra. On cat's feet, the enemy of Cleopatra entered the Carey bar to find bartender Parker serving half a dozen men. The men had time only to gape before Carry started heaving rocks that smashed the immense gilt frame and tore through the canvas. &quot;Glory to Cod!&quot; she shouted. &quot;Peace on earth, good will to men!&quot; Then she heaved another stone which crashed into the exact center of the great mirror behind the bar. (&quot;Cost fifteen hunnert dollars,&quot; bartender Parker told the police.) It tumbled in fragments. The drinkers and bartender lammed through the rear doorway, and Carry moved into the second phase of the battle. Bringing forth the wicked tool which she had fashioned from cane and iron rod, she tore around one end of the bar and began slashing at the orderly array of bottles, decanters, and glassware on the back bar. Everything disintegrated with a most satisfying noise. When Detective Park Massey, followed by curious guests, walked into the saloon, Carry had lifted one of the finest and biggest brass cuspidor^ in Kansas to the top of the cherry bar and was beating it furiously. &quot;Madam,&quot; said the officer, &quot;I must arrest you for defacing property.&quot; &quot;Defacing?&quot; she screamed. &quot;Defacing!  I am defacing nothing! I am destroying!&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:05	1	2003-08-19 08:32:43
604	Tan	4a	3	13	Communism and socialism were household words in the United States over a hundred years ago. They had simple, uncomplicated meanings then  in contrast to the mishmash of demonology they evoke today. They stood for small colonies or communities of people in which individual property had been more or less abolished and economic and social life deliberately controlled for the (presumptive) welfare of the entire group. These little Utopias set up shop under a great variety of conditions and leading ideas, and they experimented with pretty much the whole range of economic organization and social controls. What they had in common was a drive toward a better way of living and a separation from the larger society. Nearly a hundred of them are recorded in early nineteenth-century America. In most of these utopian groups, the leaders thought of their own little ventures as spearheads of a movement that was ultimately to reform and revitalize society and bring about a new golden age for all mankind. Sooner or later, all these groups either expired or came to terms with society at large. Some failed spectacularly, some dismally. The amount of energy, consecration, benevolence, and righteousness that went down the drain is appalling. The Utopias failed because of their own inadequacies of ability, of co-operation, of resources; because, in the long run, even the most successful of them could not offer values and incentives comparable to the big, bad outside world. They failed because most people found godly living and common purpose less exciting and less rewarding than the triumphs of the new mechanical and commercial civilization, and because the vision, the discipline, and the consecration Utopias required did not find lodgment in the germ plasm. Finally, they largely failed even to be recurring events because the &quot;scientific&quot; socialism of Marx proscribed the futility of little Utopias and siphoned off the energy of the rebels and dreamers to the king-size, once-and-for-all revolution. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:05	1	2003-08-19 08:33:50
605	Tan	4a	4	13	A forgotten skeleton in the closet of our social injustices is the climbing boy. In 1785, Jonas Hanway, the English champion of chimney sweepers' apprentices, coined the term &quot;climbing boy&quot; to signify a lad small enough to ascend narrow flues to remove soot or extinguish fires. Historians have generally ignored the public's callous indifference to the wicked practice, once so common along the Atlantic and in the South, of forcing children up the flues as though they were so many animated brushes. White boys and colored, free and slave, suffered greatly and died miserably in their efforts to save lives and property from dangers of fire; yet they seldom received a kind word or friendly pat on the head from those who had good reason to be indebted to them. Imported, along with the English prejudice toward the chimneysweeping trade, was the use of child labor in the flues. During the reign of James I, London architects, by adopting the Scottish fashion of constructing houses several stories high, had to find space for the additional flues needed for heating the increased number of rooms. They solved this problem by making the diameters of the new flues much narrower than the old ones and by running these elongated passages in zigzag fashion through the thick walls to the chimney top. Because this new method of flue construction prevented men sweeps from burrowing through the narrow tunnels or from poking their longhandled besoms around the right-angled turns, the sweeps turned to Italy for inspiration and borrowed the Italian custom of employing small boys  girls were sometimes used  to serve as human brooms. As chimneys in the older houses were gradually renovated to provide better drafts, when coal began to supplant wood as fuel at the end of the seventeenth century, the demand for more and more sweep boys grew until, by 1800, only the poorest of the English sweepers had no apprentices or hired boys upon whose labor they could depend for a livelihood. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:05	1	2003-07-24 18:07:07
606	Tan	4a	5	13	The ballad and the folk song have long been recognized as important keys to the thoughts and feelings of a people, but the dime novel, though sought by the collector and deferred to in a general way by the social historian, is dismissed with a smile of amusement by almost everyone else. Neither folk songs nor dime novels were actually created by the plain people of America. But in their devotion to these modes of expression, the people made them their own. The dime novel, intended as it was for the great masses and designed to fill the pockets of both author and publisher, quite naturally sought the lowest common denominator: themes that were found to be popular and attitudes that met with the most general approval became stereotyped. Moreover, the dime novel, reflecting a much wider range of attitudes and ideas than the ballad and the folk song, is the nearest thing we have had in this country to a true &quot;proletarian&quot; literature, that is, a literature written for the great masses of people and actually read by them. Although a study of our dime novels alone cannot enable anyone to determine what are the essential characteristics of the American tradition, it can contribute materially to that end. Sooner or later, the industrious researchers who have mined so many obscure lodes of American literary expression will almost certainly turn their attention to these novels and all their kind. Let no one think, however, that the salmon-covered paperbacks once so eagerly devoured by soldiers, lumberjacks, trainmen, hired girls, and adolescent boys now make exciting or agreeable reading even for the historian, much as the social and historical implications may interest him. As for the 'crowds today who get their sensational thrills from the movies and the tabloids, I fear that they would find these hair-raisers of an earlier age deadly dull. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:06	1	2003-08-19 08:35:09

608	Tan	4a	7	13	I At one time in England, the oath which one takes to tell the truth was used against the accused with devastating effect. If he refused to take the oath, he was held in contempt and punished. If he took the oath and then refused to answer a question, the refusal was taken as a confession of the thing charged in the question. Thus were men compelled to testify against themselves. A widely heralded defiance of this practice was made by John Lilburne, who was charged with sending scandalous books into England. He refused to be examined under oath, saying that the oath was &quot;both against the law of God and the law of the land.&quot; He announced that he would never take it &quot;though I be pulled in pieces by wild horses.&quot; Lilburne was held in contempt, publicly whipped, fined, and placed in solitary confinement. That was in 1638. On February 13, 1645, the House of Lords set aside that judgment, contending that it was &quot;against the liberty of the subject and the law of the land and Magna Carta.&quot; And in 1648, Lilburne was granted damages for his imprisonment. Lilburne was willing to testify on matters of which he was accused. His refusal related to questions &quot;concerning other men, to ensnare me, and get further matter against me.&quot; At that time, an accused had no immunity from testifying against himself at his own trial. Lilburne's protest, therefore, was against being compelled to testify on matters not properly charged against him. In other words, he objected to furnishing evidence which could be used as the basis for future prosecutions against him. Before the end of the seventeenth century, the immunity claimed by Lilburne had been broadly extended in England. It protected the person who was charged with a crime from testifying against himself at his own trial. It also protected any witness from testifying to anything that might possibly be incriminating in future proceedings. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:06	1	2003-08-19 08:38:52

610	Tan	4a	9	13	Though it now seems merely an episode in the last year of World War I, the influenza pandemic of the autumn of 1918 was one of the three greatest outbreaks of disease in history. Only the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death compare with it. A quarter of the world's population was affected; all in all, it killed 22 million people, almost twice as many as were killed in the war itself. In India, more people died from influenza in a few months than had died from cholera in twenty years. In the United States, half a million people died. Through centuries, the course of epidemics has run from east to west. The 1918 influenza epidemic followed this pattern, reaching America last. Traditionally, Asia has been the matrix of disease, almost as though there existed, in the vastness of Mongolia, a permanent focus of infection which would erupt periodically into the rest of the world. Some doctors maintained that the influenza was introduced by Chinese labor battalions that landed on the coast of France. Some attributed it to Russian soldiers arriving from Vladivostock. Others thought it might have developed in Spain from an earlier bronchitis which was so prevalent during the spring that the name &quot;Spanish&quot; was given to the autumn influenza. There was even one tenuous theory that the disease sprang into being in an isolated Georgia training camp during the winter of 1917 and migrated westward until it had circumnavigated the earth. Influenza is still a mysterious disease. No one yet knows whether it is one virus or several, why it occurs in cycles, or how and where it lies dormant between epidemics. There are theories of weather, theories of the wearing off of group immunity, and even a theory of determination by economic circumstances. The most generally held current explanation is, however, that a pandemic like that of 1918 arises when a new and explosive strain of virus develops through a spontaneous process of mutation or renewal. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:06	1	2003-07-24 19:11:01

612	Tan	4a	11	13	In this lackluster, pallid era of pugilism, there is always the danger that the sports writer, digging back into the yellowed archives of the American prize ring, will overglorify those giants of the past whose names recall bright and enduring legends. The lives of those pioneers of boxing were shot through with such color and drama, and they exhibited such courage and heartswelling spirit, that they make todays commercialized clouters appear weak and wicked by comparison. Can you imagine any present-day fighter slugging it out for 27 rounds with both hands broken, battling under the broiling sun on a barge in San Francisco Bay, for nothing more than a side bet of a few hundred dollars? Is there a pugilist now alive who would even consider challenging a man who outweighed him by 35 pounds  who would offer to fight, winner take all, a giant Negro touted as the best of his time, an opponent feared by the great John L. Sullivan himself? Such a fighter of those blood-soaked, thunderous days was James J. Corbett. On May 21, 1891, at the California A. C Jim fought 61 rounds to a draw with the great Negro heavyweight, Peter Jackson. This marathon contest has been rated the most outstanding exhibition of boxing skill, ring generalship, sheer stamina, and guts ever seen in a prize ring. The fabulous battle at the California A. C. indicates only a few of the many reasons why Corbett, the beloved &quot;Gentleman Jim,&quot; has gone down in ring history as one of the three or four great champions of all time and as the most respected fighter of his generation. According to many experts, Jim Corbett was the most competent, quick-witted, graceful pugilist who ever drew on gloves. He was the father of scientific boxing, the most powerful, single influence in taking the fight game out of the hands of thugs and brutes and developing it into what its devotees came to call the &quot;sweet science&quot; and the &quot;manly art of selfdefense.&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:07	1	2003-07-24 19:12:33

616	Tan	4a	15	13	The American college town has had a character and a personality unlike other towns. Cleaner, neater than other towns, with green spaces somewhere toward the center, with white spires or Gothic towers or windowed dormitories half hid by trees, they were the little capitals of the academic states. As trading or industrial centers, their life might have been indistinguishable from towns or cities of a like size, but in their social consciousness there was always some recognition of peculiarity. For the heart of the community was a college. Its subtle influences were as pervasive as, if less noticeable than, the quite unsubtle symbols of college life  playing fields, cafes, and collegiate .. clothing. And in the early 1900's, the college town was no luncheon stop for automobiles. It was secluded, even if it was a town within a city, like the Yale section of New Haven; it knew its boundaries and kept them. It was jealous of its distinctions; if it was uneasy, it was also proud. The campus and the college buildings dominated its architecture like the temple and citadel of a Greek city-state, a difficult relationship since there was always some doubt in the minds of the townfolk whether the college was an asset or a parasite. The town with its college was like a woman's club committee with a celebrity in tow  a credit to them but also an embarrassment and sometimes a nuisance; it was like a French village built upon a Roman camp to which tourists resort; it was like the mistress of an actors' boarding house, pleased by the notoriety but worried by the manners, or the morals, of her boarders. It was like almost anything but a town without a college. And many a college town was like a resentful mother who, expecting a quiet and manageable infant, had given birth to a Gargantua that swallowed whole streets and squares in its gigantic growing.  		1	2003-06-07 15:19:07	1	2003-07-24 19:14:46

618	Tan	4a	17	13	From Dr. R. S. Scorer of Britain's Imperial College of Science comes the latest theory about the cause of lightning flashes. Dr. Scorer believes the cause is hail falling through supercooled clouds. Ice particles bouncing off the falling hail acquire a positive charge and rise to the top of the cloud while the hail carries a negative charge to the bottom of the cloud. According to Dr. Scorer, Benjamin Franklin first proved thunderclouds are charged with electricity. Later investigations showed that the tops of the clouds have a great positive charge and the bottoms a great negative charge. When the charges become great enough to break down the insulating properties of the air, lightning flashes carry the electricity within the cloud, or from cloud to cloud, or from cloud to earth. But the question remained: How do the charges develop within the cloud? To seek the cause, Dr. Scorer and his colleagues at the college first duplicated thundercloud currents in a liquid tank. They found that mixture takes place only in the tops of the clouds. Next a study of thunderclouds over the North Atlantic showed that lightning occurs only when the air temperature around the cloud is below freezing. Particles at the top of the cloud begin to freeze but those in the remainder of the cloud stay unfrozen although below freezing temperature. To measure moisture, the scientists sent planes equipped with external refrigerated rods into the clouds. The idea was that moisture would freeze on the rods and could later be measured. The men found, however, that some of the moisture particles bounded off the rods. This accidental discovery set the scientists on a new course of action. In the laboratory, S. E. Reynolds whirled a refrigerated rod through ice particles and found that the particles bounced off the rod acquired a positive charge. This was the missing link. Without hail and supercooled clouds, he concluded, there could be no lightning. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:08	1	2003-08-19 08:39:32

625	Aqua	4a	4	14	When, in the age of automation, man searches for a worker to do the tedious, unpleasant jobs that are impossible to mechanize, he may very profitably consider the ape. If we tackled the problem of breeding for brains with as much  enthusiasm as we devote to breeding dogs of surrealistic shapes, we could eventually produce assorted models of useful primates, ranging in size from the gorilla down to the baboon, each adapted to a special kind of work. It is not putting too much strain on the imagination to assume that geneticists could produce a super-ape, able to understand some scores of words, and capable of being trained for such jobs as picking fruit, cleaning up the litter in parks, shining shoes, collecting garbage, doing household chores, and even baby-sitting (though I have known some babies I would not care to trust with a valuable ape). Apes could do many jobs, such as cleaning streets and the more  repetitive types of agricultural work, without supervision, though they might need protection from those egregious specimens of Homo sapiens who think it amusing to tease or bully anything they consider lower on the evolutionary ladder. For other tasks, such as delivering papers and laboring on the docks, our man-ape would have to work under human overseers; and, incidentally, I would love to see the finale of the twenty- first century version of On the Waterfront in which the honest but hairy hero will drum on his chest after  literally  taking the wicked labor leader apart. Once a supply of nonhuman workers becomes available, a whole range of low IQ jobs could be thankfully relinquished by mankind, to its great mental and physical advantage. What is more, one of the problems which has plagued so many fictional Utopias would be avoided: There would be none of the degradingly subhuman Epsilons of Huxley's Brave New World to act as a permanent reproach to society, for there is a profound moral difference between breeding sub-men and super-apes, though the end products are much the same. The first would introduce a form of slavery; the second would be a biological triumph which could benefit both men and animals. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:09	1	2003-07-22 06:57:12

628	Aqua	4a	7	14	We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with a fervent passion for them when anyone challenges or questions them. Obviously, it is not that the ideas themselves are dear to us, but rather that our self-esteem is threatened. We are by nature stubbornly pledged to defend our own from attack, whether it be our person, our family, our property, or our opinion. A United States senator once remarked to a friend of mine that God Almighty could not make him change his mind on our Latin-American policy. We may surrender, but we rarely confess ourselves vanquished. In the intellectual world, at least, peace is without victory. Few of us take the pains to study the origins of our cherished convictions; indeed, we have a natural repugnance to so doing. We like to continue believing what we have been accustomed to accepting as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to them. The result is that most of our so-called reasoning consists of finding arguments for continuing to believe as we already do. This spontaneous and loyal support of our preconceptions  this process of finding &quot;good&quot; reasons to justify our routine beliefsis known to modern psychologists as &quot;rationalization,&quot; clearly a new name for a very ancient thing. Our good reasons ordinarily have no value in promoting honest enlightenment, because, no matter how solemnly they may be marshaled, they are at bottom the result of personal preference or prejudice, and not of an honest desire to seek or accept new knowledge. In our reveries, we are frequently engaged in self-justification, for we cannot bear to think ourselves wrong; yet we have constant illustrations of our weaknesses and mistakes. So we spend much time finding fault with circumstances and the conduct of others, and shifting onto them with .great ingenuity the onus of our own failures and disappointments. Rationalization is the self-exculpation which occurs when we feel ourselves, or our group, accused of misapprehension or error. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:52:23
629	Aqua	4a	8	14	Wholly aside from aesthetic and moral considerations, fashion is an economic absurdity, and there is little to be said in its favor. Nevertheless, we can appreciate the wisdom in Gina Lombroso's belief that the enormous stress which women lay on everything pertaining to clothes and the art of personal adornment is connected with the tendency to crystallize sentiment into an object. Woman symbolizes every important event in her life by a special dress; and a jewel or a beautiful gown means to a woman what an official decoration means to a man. &quot; The temptation of dress is the last step in the ceremony to which the novice has to submit before entering the cloister. The memory of the gown which she too might have worn was the strongest temptation that assailed St. Catherine before she took her solemn vows  a gown, embroidered with gold and stars, like those her sisters had worn, which her grandchildren would have gazed at with eyes filled with wonder and admiration. . . . &quot;If a woman's clothes cost the family and society a little time, money, and activity, they allow woman, independent of lies and calumnies, to triumph and come to the fore outside of man's world and competition. They allow woman to satisfy her desire to be the first in the most varied fields by giving her the illusion that she is first, and at the same time enabling her rival to have the same illusion. Clothes absorb some of woman's activity which might otherwise be diverted to more or less worth-while ends; they give woman real satisfaction, a satisfaction complete in itself, and independent of others, and . . . they constitute a safety valve which saves society from much greater and more dangerous evils than those which they cause.&quot; The aptness of these observations lies in the emphasis on clothes which are really beautiful and distinctive. But fashion is not primarily concerned with beauty; and fashion connotes conformity, not the individuality so cherished by our society and so artfully suggested by the copywriters. Many people who rigorously follow fashions believe they are following their own inclinations; they are unaware of the primitive, tribal compulsion; and this is true of fashions in manners, morals, and literature, as well as in clothes. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:54:35
630	Aqua	4a	9	14	A wave of the magic wand, and elemental forces are unchained; rhythmically, the orchestra is guided by Toscanini's clear-cut and virile movements. On, on, on; we feel, we breathe, in unison. Suddenly, the performance, which to us who are less sensitive than the conductor seems to be going flawlessly, is stopped by a sharp tap on the podium. Silence fills the hall till the stillness is broken by Toscanini's tired and irritable &quot;No, no! No, no!&quot; This abrupt negative, this pained exclamation, is like a sigh of reproach. Something has disturbed him. The sound of the instruments, plain to us all, has been discordant with the music of Toscanini's vision, audible to him alone. Quietly, civilly, speaking very much to the point, the conductor now tries to make the orchestra understand how he feels the music should be rendered. He raises his baton once more, and the faulty phrase is repeated, less faultily indeed; but the orchestral reproduction is not yet in full harmony with the master's inward audition. Again he stops the performance with a tap. This time the explanation that ensues is less patient, more irritable. Eager to make his meaning perfectly plain, he uses all his powers of persuasion, and so great is his faculty for expression that in him the gesticulative talent proper to an Italian rises to the pitch of genius. Even the most unmusical person cannot fail to grasp, from his gestures, what he wants, what he demands, when he demonstrates the rhythm, when he imploringly throws his arms wide and then fervently clasps them at his breast to stress the need of a more lively interpretation, or when, setting his whole body plastically to work, he gives visual image of the tone-sequences in his mind. More and more passionately does he employ the arts of persuasion, imploring, aiming, counting, singing; becoming, so to say, each instrument in turn as he wishes to stimulate the performer who plays it: one sees him acting the movements of a violinist, a flautist, a kettledrummer. . . . 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:56:46

632	Aqua	4a	11	14	In a family where the roles of men and women are not sharply separated and where many household tasks are shared to a greater or lesser extent, notions of male superiority are hard to maintain. The pattern of sharing in tasks and in decisions makes for equality, and this in turn leads to further sharing. In such a home, the growing boy and girl learn to accept that equality more easily than did their parents and to prepare more fully for participation in a world characterized by co-operation rather than by the &quot;battle of the sexes.&quot; If the process goes too far and man's role is regarded as less important and that has happened in some cases  we are as badly off as before, only in reverse. It is time to reassess the role of the man in the American family. We are getting a little tired of &quot;Momism&quot;  but we don't want to exchange it for a &quot;neo-Popism.&quot; What we need, rather, is the recognition that bringing up children involves a partnership of equals. There are signs that psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and specialists on the family are becoming more aware of the part men play and that they have decided that women should not receive all the credit  nor all the blame. We have almost given up saying that a woman's place is in the home. We are beginning, however, to analyze man's place in the home and to insist that he does have a place in it. Nor is that place irrelevant to the healthy development of the child. The family is a co-operative enterprise for which it is difficult to lay down rules, because each family needs to work out its own ways for solving its own problems. Excessive authoritarianism has unhappy consequences, whether it wears skirts or trousers, and the ideal of equal rights and equal responsibilities is pertinent not only to a healthy democracy, but also to a healthy family. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:10	1	2003-07-25 15:59:50

634	Aqua	4a	13	14	Ideas about &quot;spoiling&quot; children have always involved consideration of just what is a spoiled child, how does spoiling occur, and what are the consequences of spoiling; they have always included concepts of a child's nature and concepts of the ideal child and the ideal adult. The many mothers of 1820 who belonged to the early &quot;maternal associations&quot; struggled to uphold the ideas about child raising that had been prevalent in the eighteenth century. They had always been told that the spoiled child stood in danger of having trouble later in life (when exposed to all the temptations of the world) and, more importantly, stood in danger of spiritual ruin. At first, the only approach these mothers knew was to &quot;break the will&quot; of the child. This approach, coming initially from the theology of Calvin, the French Protestant reformer, was inherited from the stern outlook of the Puritans. As one mother wrote, &quot;No child has ever been known, since the earliest period of the world, destitute of an evil disposition  however sweet it appears.&quot; Infant depravity, by which was meant the child's impulses, could be curbed only by breaking the will so that the child submitted implicitly to parental guidance. In 1834, a mother described this technique: Upon the father's order, her 16-month-old daughter had refused to say &quot;Dear Mama&quot; so the toddler was left alone in a room where she screamed wildly for ten minutes. After the ten minutes, the child was commanded again, and again she refused, so she was whipped and ordered again. This continued for four hours until the child finally obeyed. Parents commonly reported that after one such trial of &quot;will,&quot; the child became permanently submissive. In passing, we can note that knowledge about a child's &quot;No&quot; period might have moderated the disciplining of little children and the application of the adage &quot;Spare the rod and spoil the child.&quot; By freeing the child from its evil nature, parents believed they could then guide the child into acquiring the right character traits, such as honesty, industriousness, and sobriety. These moral principles, fixed in the child's character, were to govern it throughout life, in a society where free enterprise, individual effort, and competition were believed to be the ruling forces. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:11	1	2003-07-25 16:17:53
635	Aqua	4a	14	14	The enormous difference in Chinese dialects has been a continuing problem ever since China became an empire in 221 B.C., and it is one big reason why the country has remained impoverished. Of the 600 million people who call themselves Chinese, all but a very small number speak Chinese. But the dialects vary so widely that the speech of Peking, for example, is as different from the speech of Canton as English is from German. There is, to be sure, only one written language for all China, but it bears no phonetic relationship to any of the spoken dialects. Moreover, it has so many symbols that only a tiny portion of the population has ever mastered it. As a result, most Chinese have been isolated for centuries from a free flow of ideas and from the economic progress that such a flow produces. Many dynasties tried with little success to break down the wall. The present Communist regime, recognizing the importance of having a literate people for working in a technological world and for developing an effective propaganda machine, is putting everything it has into tackling the language problem. But the obstacles are so formidable that the results cannot yet be predicted. At the heart of the problem are the dialects. The dialects prevented the evolution of a single written language based on phonetics. Instead, the Chinese were forced to develop a system which has no relation to sound, and they have clung to it for more than 3,000 years. When this system is applied to a whole language, it results in an overwhelming number of symbols. There are about 50,000 entries in a Chinese dictionary not counting the compounds. In order to be literate, a Chinese must learn 6,000; to be moderately educated, 12,000. An English-speaking child, having to conquer only a twenty-six letter alphabet, has usually learned to read by the time he begins the third grade. A Chinese child needs at least five more years of elementary learning; in the seventh grade, he can barely read a Chinese newspaper. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:11	1	2003-08-19 07:37:45
636	Aqua	4a	15	14	Few modern works of social science have aroused so wide an interest as David Riesman's study of the changing American character, The Lonely Crowd. Published in 1950 by a university press, it soon transcended the limited audience for which it was intended. When the book was brought out in a paper-bound edition, it sold so widely that it became a prodigy of the publishing world. The terminology of the work, especially the phrases &quot;inner directed&quot; and &quot;other directed,&quot; has become part of the American vocabulary. The Lonely Crowd presents the hypothesis that there has been a significant change in the character and ideals of the American people over the past few decades. This change is described as a movement from &quot;inner direction&quot; to &quot;other direction.&quot; It is not possible in this space to do justice to the meaning of the two concepts. In general, it may be said that the trend away from inner direction toward other direction implies that the ambitious, competitive character, who is highly individualistic and makes great demands on himself (and others), is becoming less typical of the American culture, and is yielding to a less assertive and more conciliatory character, attuned to the requirements of the group either in cooperation or in conformity, and taking direction from the ideals and demands of others. Mr. Riesman wishes not to be partisan with either form of &quot;direction,&quot; although he is aware that most of his readers will find that inner direction, as he describes it, is more attractive than other direction. He accepts neither as an ideal form of motivation, and offers as an escape from both the difficult ideal of autonomy. But as an objective observer of American life, he can note the advantages as well as the dangers of the new tendency. He sees the diminution of inner direction as implying a lessening of individualism, personal self-definition, energy, and sheer interestingness. But he is no less aware that the increase of other direction implies a lessening of raw competitiveness and an increase of cooperativeness and of friendliness, if not of friendship. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:11	1	2003-08-19 07:40:15
637	Aqua	4a	16	14	In James Jones's first novel, sheer intensity of feeling triumphed over crudity of style and mind: the author was so powerfully possessed by his experience of the peacetime army, an area new to American fiction, that he was able to give his rough-hewn story an elemental vitality. In his new novel, Jones is no longer working with materials as fresh or as highly charged as those of From Here to Eternity, and he is even more prolix: Some Came Running stretches to about 650,000 words, the length of six average novels. The net result is that the author's deficiencies as a writer force themselves on the reader with painful insistence. His prose  besides being riddled with such ungrammatical atrocities as &quot;she had brought some medieval-looking candles which she liked to turn off all the lights and eat by the light of&quot;  is plodding, clumsy, and repetitious; it has a drabness as dispiriting as the &quot;eats&quot; on the counter of a sleazy beanery. The savage passion which energized From Here to Eternity is muffled, and there remains the yammer of self-pity, to which is now added the earnest drone of portentous banalities.. Out of the author's hope chest of ideas come tumbling all the fuzzy bits and pieces of thoughts solemnly cherished by an essentially primitive mind  a half-baked theory about the relation of love to writing; palaver about &quot;Karmic attachments&quot;; commonplace conclusions about the discrepancy between reality and the illusions men live by; and sententious inanities about &quot;being a writer.&quot; The effect of all this is to make Some Came Running an outsize example of the &quot;hick&quot; novel. The central strand of the novel is the worst part of it. The surrounding picture of small-town life contains a good many first-rate characterizations  Dave's elder brother, with his mixture of hardness and weakness, his secret lecheries, his cagey advance from modest storekeeper to millionaire-businessman, is a masterly creation  and there are enough forcefully realized episodes or scenes to suggest that Jones might do a lot better if he were to conquer his thousand-page-or-more complex. As it stands, however, his novel represents the dubious victory of six years' perspiration over lack of inspiration. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:11	1	2003-07-25 16:41:15
638	Aqua	4a	17	14	The mythopoeic power of the movies has given the movies a quasireligious status and a structure that differs radically from any other literary or theatrical genre. As the anecdote is the concrete substance of the short story and novel, gossip of the drama, and soliloquy of the modern poem, so the daydream is the concrete substance and focal point of the movies. The movie theater itself is like a working model, or templet, of a huge mind. While the brilliant, hypnotic screen converges all light and movement in the darkness  both the private darkness within and the public darkness of the theater are illuminated at once by the same images  a simple faith on the part of the audience ( &quot;the camera never lies&quot;) suspends any disbelief in the projected reality of what it sees. What a machine for the cretinization of the masses! The dead pan with which the camera records its pictures is like the reassuring, legal prose of Kafka's dream narratives, whereby, keeping a straight face, the most incredible characters and events are detailed with such consistently monotonous gravity of emphasis that the fantastic can be taken at its face value. Conversely, the factual events shown in the newsreels  senators speaking, flood waters rising in Iowa, people starving in China, etc.  are somehow transformed to the same illusory plane as the feature production itself. The shadows of the movies flicker between the black-and-white world of positive fact and the chrome world of fantasy, both unreeled on a single beam of light. But this spooky lighting effect is a device of a ritual much older than the movies. As a poet observed in the seventeenth century: Darkness in churches congregates the sight; Devotion strays in open, daring light, . . . The silver screen, the hush, the darkness is a kind of secret Mass where all who attend partake of the Host in common; and, to project along this line into the near future, the movies may yet find in television a comparable Reformation, in which the individual will be left to face his own screen alone. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:11	1	2003-07-25 16:43:12
639	Aqua	4a	18	14	There has arisen during this twentieth century (as it arose before, in ages which we like to call dark) a pronounced anti-intellectualism, a feeling that both studies and literature are not merely vain, but also somehow untrustworthy. With people swayed by this feeling there is little use in arguing, either for history or literature, or for poetry or music, or for the arts in general. With others, there is still faith that any civilization worthy of the name must be grounded in a ceaseless pursuit of truth. Whether truth is sought through study or through the arts makes no difference. Any pursuit of truth is not only worth-while; it is the foundation stone of civilization, The study and reading of history is one of those approaches to truth. It is only one; all the arts and sciences are such approaches. All have their place; all are good; and each touches the other. They are not airtight compartments. It is only in a few institutions, afflicted by mental arteriosclerosis, that events like the Industrial Revolution are pre-empted entirely by the historians, the social scientists, or the physical scientists. Is <i>Pepys's Diary</i> history or sociology or literature? Only within the past hundred years have historians found that what people have done in literature and art is a part of their history. Books like <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, <i>Ten Nights in a Bar Room</i>, and <i>The Crisis</i> have themselves helped to make history. Even at the moment, when scientific investigation becomes more and more specialized and the historian concentrates more and more fiercely on periods and episodes, it is becoming clearer to the layman that all this is part of one whole. Even at a time when textbooks are being written to introduce to the theoretical physicist his brethren who are working as chemists or engineers on perhaps the same problem, the layman is far enough removed from all this specialization to see the whole, possibly even more clearly than do the specialists. Between history, biography, the arts and sciences, and even journalism, who shall draw airtight distinctions? Not laymen. Is not yesterday's newspaper history, and may it not be literature? 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:12	1	2003-08-19 07:44:26
640	Aqua	4a	19	14	In most of the human civilizations of which we have any proper records, youth has drawn on either art or life for models, planning to emulate the heroes depicted in epics, on the shadow-play screen or the stage, or those known human beings, fathers or grandfathers, chiefs or craftsmen, whose every characteristic can be studied and imitated. As recently as 1910, this was the prevailing condition in the United States. If he came from a nonliterate background, the recent immigrant learned to speak, move, and think like an American by using his eyes and ears on the labor line and in the homes of more acculturated cousins, by watching school children, or by absorbing the standards of the teacher, the foreman, the clerk who served him in the store. For the literate and the literate children of the nonliterate, there was art  the story of the frustrated artist in the prairie town, of the second generation battling with the limitations of the first. And at a simpler level, there were the Western and Hollywood fairy tales which pointed a moral but did not, as a rule, teach table manners. With the development of the countermovement against Hollywood, with the efflorescence of photography, with Time-Life-Fortune types of reporting and the dead-pan New Yorker manner of describing the life of an old-clothes dealer in a forgotten street or of presenting the &quot;accurate,&quot; &quot;checked&quot; details of the lives of people whose eminence gave at least a sort of license to attack them, with the passion for &quot;human documents&quot; in Depression days  a necessary substitute for proletarian art among middle-class writers who knew nothing about proletarians, and middle-class readers who needed the shock of verisimilitude  a new era in American life was ushered in, the era in which young people imitated neither life nor art nor fairy tale, but instead were presented with models drawn from life with minimal but crucial distortions. Doctored life histories, posed carelessness, &quot;candid&quot; shots of people in their own homes which took hours to arrange, pictures shot from real life to scripts written months before  supplemented by national polls and surveys which assured the reader that this bobby soxer did indeed represent a national norm or a growing trend  replaced the older models. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:12	1	2003-07-25 16:48:21

642	Purple	4a	1	15	Government is not made in virtue of natural rights, which may and do exist in total independence of it; and exist in much greater clearness, and in a much greater degree of abstract perfection: but their abstract perfection is their practical defect. By having a right to everything, men want everything. Government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants. Men have a right that these wants should be provided for by this wisdom. Among these wants is to be reckoned the want, out of civil society, of a sufficient restraint upon their passions. Society requires not only that the passions of individuals should be subjected, but that even in the mass and body, as well as in the individuals, the inclinations of men should frequently be thwarted, their will controlled, and their passions brought into subjection. This can only be done by a power out of themselves: and not, in the exercise of its function, subject to that will and those passions which it is its office to bridle and subdue. In this sense, the restraints on men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights. But as the liberties and the restrictions vary with times and circumstances, and admit to infinite modifications, they cannot be settled upon by any abstract rule; and nothing is so foolish as to discuss them upon that principle. 
   The moment you abate anything from the full rights of men, each to govern himself, and suffer any artificial, positive limitation upon those rights, from that moment the whole organization of government becomes a consideration of convenience. This it is which makes the constitution of a state, and the due distribution of its powers, a matter of the most delicate and complicated skill. It requires a deep knowledge of human nature and human necessities, and of the things which facilitate or obstruct the various ends, which are to be pursued by the mechanism of civil institutions. The state is to have recruits to its strength, and remedies to its distempers. What is the use of discussing a man's abstract right to food or medicine? The question is upon the method of procuring and administering them. In that deliberation, I shall always advise to call in the aid of the farmer and the physician, rather than the professor of metaphysics. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:12	1	2004-03-24 13:01:37
643	Purple	4a	2	15	For more than fifty years we have known, or could have known, that there is an unconscious to counterbalance consciousness. Medical psychology has furnished all the necessary empirical and experimental proofs of an unconscious psychic reality which demonstrably influences consciousness and behavior. All this is known, but no practical conclusions have been drawn from it. We still go on thinking and acting as if we were simplex and not duplex. Accordingly, we imagine ourselves to be innocuous, reasonable, and humane. We do not think of distrusting our motives, or of asking ourselves how the inner man feels about the things we do in the outside world, but actually it is frivolous, superficial, and unreasonable of us, as well as psychically unhygienic, to overlook the reaction and viewpoint of the unconscious. 
   One can regard one's stomach or heart as unimportant or even worthy of contempt, but nevertheless overeating and overexertion have consequences which affect the whole man. Yet we think that psychic mistakes and their consequences can be erased by mere words, for &quot;psychic&quot; means less than air to most people. All the same, nobody can deny that without the psyche there would be no world at all and still less a human world. Virtually everything depends on the human soul and its functions. It is worthy of all the attention we can give it, especially today when everyone admits that the weal or woe of the future will be decided not by attacks of wild animals, by natural catastrophes, or by the danger of world-wide epidemics, but rather by the psychic changes in man. 
   Only an almost imperceptible disturbance of equilibrium in a few of our rulers' heads could plunge the world into blood, fire, and radioactivity. The technical means to this destruction are available to both sides. And certain conscious deliberations, uncontrolled by an inner opponent, can be all too easily indulged, as we have already seen from the example of one &quot;leader.&quot; The consciousness of modern man still clings so much to outward objects that he believes them exclusively responsible, as if it were on them that decisions depended. That the psychic state of certain individuals could emancipate itself for once from the behavior of objects is something that is considered far too little, although irrationalities of this sort are observed every day and can happen to everyone. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:12	1	2004-03-24 13:02:16
644	Purple	4a	3	15	We have come a long way since the elder Huxley charged us to sit down before the simple facts  and learn! There is something congenial and comforting about sitting to learn, and especially sitting before the kind of facts presented to millions of Americans week after week. Perhaps this is a clue to the popularity of the rash of quiz shows, challenges, and $64,000 questions that provide tidbits for distracted minds in the sitting rooms of America, The facts before which we sit are so painless, so personally irrelevant, so disconnected from each other and the living issues of our time, so flat, formal, and void of value, that the most appropriate posture to assume is a seated one. 
   Though millions may sit on the edge of their seats before the quiz show we may presume it is not because of the remembered and rehearsed facts, but rather because of the vicarious human thrills received from viewing this most recent competitive sport. Many, of course, rejoice at the turn in our national interest from football and fights to facts. 
   But there is something sinister in our excitement over this kind of untroubling fact, and in our willingness to sleep  not even sit  before the facts that are painfully pertinent and personally relevant to human significance and survival. One has but to recall the amazing complacency before the facts of social revolution among the exploited and underdeveloped peoples of the world in recent years, mounting tensions in the South, the rapid erosion of integrity and character in family and public life, and the swift successes of the Soviet Union in economy, technology, and diplomacy, to realize how little we learn from our present posture, and how trifling are the facts before which we do sit. 
   We too readily forget that no fact, however scientifically simon-pure, is in itself sufficient to provide meaning or motivation for men. Its meaning is given not as we sit before it, memorize, record, or reproduce it; but as we see it related, interpreted, and evaluated in relation to other facts and systems of meaning. Facts become pertinent to motivation when their meaning engages decisive human concern, whether for survival, power, curiosity, or service. The meaning may be manufactured by dogma more than by discovery, and the motivation by fear or force more than by free choice, but both reveal the poverty of scientific facts alone to illumine  much less save  the human situation. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:13	1	2004-03-24 13:02:49
645	Purple	4a	4	15	At home, and especially at night, Brutus was not the same man. Sometimes, against his will, his working cares would make him start out of his sleep; other times, he was taken up with his further reflection and consideration of his difficulties, so that his wife that lay with him could not choose but take notice that he was full of unusual trouble, and had in agitation some dangerous and perplexing question. 
   Portia, being addicted to philosophy, a great lover of her husband, and full of an understanding courage, resolved not to inquire into Brutus' secrets before she had made this trial of herself: she turned all her attendants out of her chamber and, taking a little knife such as they used to cut nails with, she gave herself a deep gash in the thigh; upon which followed a great flow of blood and, soon after, violent pains and a shivering fever occasioned by the wound. Now, when Brutus was extremely anxious and afflicted for her, she, in the height of all .her pain, spoke thus to him: &quot;I, Portia, being the daughter of Cato, was given to you in marriage, not like a concubine, to partake only in the common intercourse of bed and board, but to bear a part in all your good and all your evil fortunes; and for your part, as regards your care for me, I find no reason to complain; but from me, what evidence of my love, what satisfaction can you receive, if I may not share with you in bearing your hidden griefs, nor be admitted to any of your counsels that require secrecy and trust? I know very well that women seem to be of too weak a nature to be trusted with secrets; but certainly, Brutus, a virtuous birth and education, and the company of the good and honorable, are of some force to the forming of our manners; but I can boast that I am the daughter of Cato, and the wife of Brutus, in which two titles though before I put less confidence, yet now I have tried myself, and find that I can bid defiance to pain.&quot; 
   Which words having spoken, Portia showed Brutus her wound, and related to him the trial that she had made of her constancy; at which he, being astonished, lifted up his hands to heaven, and begged the assistance of the gods in his enterprise, that he might show himself a husband worthy of such a wife as Portia. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:13	1	2004-03-24 13:03:19
646	Purple	4a	5	15	There is severe classic tragedy within major-league baseball, tragedy which catches and manipulates the life of every athlete as surely as forces beyond the heaths manipulated Hardy's simple Wessex folk into creatures of imposing stature. 
   Major-league baseball is an insecure society; it pays a lavish salary to an athlete and then, when he reaches thirty-five or so, it abruptly stops paying him anything. But the tragedy goes considerably deeper than that. Briefly, it is the tragedy of fulfillment. 
   Each major leaguer, like his childhood friends, always wanted desperately to become a major leaguer. Whenever there was trouble at home, in school, or with a girl, there was the sure escape of baseball; not the stumbling, ungainly escape of an ordinary ballplayer, but a sudden, wondrous metamorphosis into the role of a hero. For each major leaguer was first a star in his neighborhood or in his town, and each lived with the unending solace that there was one thing he could always do with grace and skill and poise. Somehow, he once believed with the most profound faith he possessed, that if he ever did make the major leagues, everything would then become ideal. 
   A major-league baseball team is comprised of twenty-five youngish men who have made the major leagues and discovered that, in spite of it, life remains distressingly short of ideal. In retrospect, they were better off during the years when their adolescent dream was happily simple and vague. Among the twenty-five youngish men of a ball club, who individually held the common dream which came to be fulfilled, cynicism and disillusion are common as grass. So Willie Mays angrily announces that he will henceforth charge six hundred dollars to be interviewed, and Duke Snider shifts his dream-site from a ball park to an avocado farm overlooking the Pacific, and Peewee Reese tries to fight off a momentary depression by saying: &quot;Sure I dreamt about baseball when I was a kid, but not the night games. No, sir. I did not dream about the lights.&quot; 
   For most men, the business of shifting and reworking dreams comes late in life, when there are older children upon whose unwilling shoulders the tired dreams may be deposited. It is a harsh, jarring thing to have to shift dreams at thirty, and if there is ever to be a major novel written about baseball, it will have to come to grips with this theme. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:13	1	2004-03-24 13:03:34
647	Purple	4a	6	15	The old-fashioned parent who sets out to buy a table-game warranted to both elevate and amuse must not expect instant success. 
   What is he offered? For a start, there is that hardy perennial in which the object is to amass the greatest number of houses, hotels, and public utilities, with a view to rack-renting all comers and driving them into deeper mortgage. Another much-recommended game invites its players to double their savings on the stock exchange, either by reckless gambling in one commodity or by a judicious spreadover of investments. Hesitantly, the parent explains that these games are not quite what he had in mind: &quot;Haven't you something a bit more  well, I hardly like to say it, but improving?&quot; Flinching at the dirty word, the debutante behind the counter replies: &quot;Nobody has ever asked for anything like that!&quot; 
    Our forbears kept a sterner watch on these things. To them, the table-game was a much-esteemed device for grounding the child in virtuous precepts; in later life, he could be relied upon to learn for himself, as his elders had done, how to adapt these precepts to the arts of profit and monopoly. 
   Consider &quot;The Game of Human Life,&quot; which was all the rage at pious firesides on Christmas Day, 1790. The publisher, John Wallis, explained that in order &quot;to avoid introducing a dicebox into private families,&quot; the game was to be played with a more seemly device  a teetotum. Along the road to be traversed by the players were scenes depicting Virtue and Vice. It was Mr. Wallis' earnest wish that parents should call the players' attention to &quot;a few moral and judicious observations explanatory of each Character as they proceed, and contrast the happiness of a Virtuous and well-spent life with the fatal consequences arising from Vicious and Immoral pursuits.&quot; The type of hazard encountered may be judged by these excerpts from the rules: 
   &quot;The Dramatist at 44 shall pay four stakes to the Masters of his art and shall begin the game again.&quot; 
   &quot;The Satyrist at 77 shall pay four stakes and go back to the Malignant Boy at 8.&quot; 
   This might suggest that Mr. Wallis was opposed to all forms of literary endeavor. Far from it. 
   &quot;The Tragic Author at 45 shall go to the place of the Immortal Man at 84 and win the game.&quot; 
   We do not know who Mr. John Wallis was, and must therefore be excused for suspecting that he was, or had sought to be, a Tragic Author. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:13	1	2004-03-23 17:56:54
648	Purple	4a	7	15	The scattering of galaxies, the habits of macromolecules, and the astounding abundance of stars are forcing those who ponder such matters to a further adjustment of their concept of the place and function of man in the material universe. 
   In the history of the evolving human mind, with its increasing knowledge of the surrounding world, there must have been a time when the philosophers of the early tribes began to realize that the world was not simply anthropocentric  centered on man himself. The geocentric concept then became common doctrine. It accepted a universe centered on the earth. This first adjustment was only mildly deflationary to the human ego, for man appeared to surpass all other living forms. 
   The second adjustment in the understanding of man's relation to the physical universe, that is, the abandonment of the earth-center theory, was not generally acceptable until the sixteenth-century Copernican revolution soundly established the heliocentric concept  the theory of a universe centered on the sun. Man is a stubborn adherent to official dogma; eventually, however, he accepted the sun as the center not only of the local family of planets, but also of the total sidereal assemblage, and he long held that view. 
   Then, less than forty years ago, came the inescapable need for a third adjustment. This shift has deeply punctured man's pride and self-assurance, for it has carried with it the knowledge of the appalling number of galaxies. 
   The &quot;galactocentric universe&quot; suddenly puts the earth and its life near the edge of one great galaxy in a universe of millions of galaxies. Man becomes peripheral among the billions of stars of his own Milky Way; and, according to the revelations of paleontology and geochemistry, he is recent and apparently ephemeral in the unrolling of cosmic time. We cannot restore geocentrism or heliocentrism. And since we cannot go back to the cramped but comfortable past, we go forward and find there is more to the story. 
   The downgrading of the earth and sun and the elevation of the galaxies is not the end of this progress of scientific pilgrims through philosophic fields. The need for another jolting adjustment now appears  not wholly unexpected by workers in science, nor wholly the result of one or two scientific revelations. 
   Our new problem concerns the spread of life throughout the universe. As unsolicited spokesmen for all the earthly organisms of land, sea, and air, we ask the piquant question: Are we alone? 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:13	1	2004-03-23 17:58:19
649	Purple	4a	11	15	Virtues are as natural to man as his digestive organs; any sober biologist, taking into consideration man's gregarious instincts, would naturally expect to find them. 
   This being the case, there is nothing in these virtues a la Dickens to &quot;write home about&quot;  as we used to say at a time when we were remarkably rich in virtues. There is no reason to be particularly proud of qualities which we inherit from our animal forefathers and share with our household pets. The gratifying thing would be to find, in contemporary society, evidence of peculiarly human virtues  the conscious,  rational virtues that by definition ought to belong to a being calling himself (Homo sapiens  as open-mindedness, absence of irrational prejudice, complete tolerance, and a steady, reasonable pursuit of social goods. But these, alas, are precisely what we fail to discover. For to what, after all, is all this squalor, this confusion, this ugliness due but to the lack of human virtues? The fact is that  except for an occasional sport of Nature, born now here, now there, and always out of time  we sapient men have practically no human virtues at all. So complete is the lack of truly human qualities that we are reduced, if we  condescend to look at reality at all, to acting like Charles Dickens and congratulating the race on its merely animal virtues. The jolly,  optimistic fellows who assure us that humanity is all rightbecause mothers love their children, poor folk pity and help one another, and soldiers die for a flag  are comforting us on the grounds that we resemble whales, elephants, and bees. But when we ask them to adduce evidence of human sapience, to give us a few specimens of conscious and  reasonable well-doing, they rebuke us for our intellectual coldness and our general &quot;inhumanity&quot;  which means our refusal to be content with the standards of animals. However grateful we may feel for the existence in civilized society of these homely jungle virtues, we cannot justifiably set them off against the horrors and squalors of civilized life. The  horrors and squalors arise from men's lack of reason  from their failure to be completely and sapiently human. The jungle virtues are merely the obverse of this animalism, whose &quot;heads&quot; is instinctive kindliness and whose &quot;tails&quot; is stupidity and instinctive cruelty.  		1	2003-06-07 15:19:13	1	2004-03-23 18:01:48
650	Purple	4a	8	15	Much of the American anxiety about old age is a flight from the reality of death. One of the striking qualities of the American character is the unwillingness to face either the fact or meaning of death. In the more somber tradition of American literature  from Hawthorne and Melville and Poe to Faulkner and Hemingway  one finds a tragic depth that belies the surface thinness of the ordinary American death attitudes. By an effort of the imagination, the great writers faced problems which the culture in action is reluctant to face  the fact of death, its mystery, and its place in the back-and-forth shuttling of the eternal recurrence. The unblinking confrontation of death in Greek times, the elaborate theological patterns woven around it in the Middle Ages, the ritual celebration of it in the rich, peasant cultures of Latin and Slavic Europe and in primitive cultures; these are difficult to find in American life.
    Whether through fear of the emotional depths, or because of a drying up of the sluices of religious intensity, the American avoids dwelling on death or even coming to terms with it; he finds it morbid and recoils from it, surrounding it with word avoidance (Americans never die; they &quot;pass away&quot; ) and various taboos of speech and practice. A &quot;funeral parlor&quot; is decorated to look like a bank; everything in a funeral ceremony is done in hushed tones, as if it were something furtive, to be concealed from the world; there is so much emphasis on being dignified that the ceremony often loses its quality of dignity. In some of the primitive cultures, there is difficulty in understanding the causes of death; it seems puzzling and even unintelligible. Living in a scientific culture, Americans have a ready enough explanation of how it comes, yet they show little capacity to come to terms with the fact of death itself and with the grief that accompanies it. &quot;We jubilate over birth and dance at weddings,&quot; writes Maragaret Mead, &quot;but more and more hustle the dead off the scene without ceremony, without an opportunity for young and old to realize that death is as much a fact of life as is birth.&quot; And, one may add, even in its hurry and brevity, the last stage of an American's life  the last occasion of his relation to his society  is as standardized as the rest. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:14	1	2004-03-23 17:59:28
651	Purple	4a	9	15	Marlon Brando is the overwhelmingly outstanding creative artist among contemporary American film actors. Kirk Douglas can sometimes match Brando in force, but he lacks Brando's subtley and pathos; Burt Lancaster has comparable ambition but small talent. Brando begins with a good actor's instrument  his body. Not a huge man, he is both solid and lithe. We are, perhaps, too much aware of the basic physical effect of his chest partially covered by a torn undershirt; but, more to the point, Marion Brando seems to carry in him a silently humming dynamo of energy, bridled and instantly ready. Whenever he moves, something seems to impend. Indisputably, there is in acting an element that is often called star quality; in Brando, it is this constant hint of possible lightning.
    Actors, even more than most artists, are restricted by their personalities, but Brando strives to expand as far as possible, to use himself in playing other people rather than to bring those people to himself. In <i>The Young Lions</i>, for instance, we can see at once that he has caught perfectly the stiff cordiality, the slightly declamatory speech, the somewhat angular movements, the charm and the consciousness of charm that create another man  Diestl  for us. Yet, Brando shows us that paradox which is part of the fascination of acting because he is also always and unmistakably Brando, not some flavorless hack with a wig and a putty nose and a laboriously disguised voice. 
   Brando has evolved a personal style which relies largely on understatement and the liberal use of pauses. Often the effect is heartbreaking; remember the poignancy he evoked from the vapid monosyllabic &quot;Wow&quot; in <i>On the Waterfront</i>, when he realized that his brother was threatening his life. Occasionally, his style lapses out of meaning and into mannerism; some of <i>Sayonara</i> could have used compression. 
   But in essence, Brando reflects in his style  as actors often do  the prevalent artistic vein of his day. Kemble exemplified the classic, elegant eighteenth century; Kean, the wild, torrential romantics of the early nineteenth century; lrving, the elaborate majesty of the late Victorians. I compare Brando to these luminaries only to draw a parallel. He is a taciturn realist: an epitome not of that joyous, realistic revolution which swept away the humbug that had obscured the contours of the world, but of that generation, born into realism, which has seen its world with harsh clarity, and whose work is to reconcile itself to that world's revealed boundaries and to find its triumphs inwardly. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:14	1	2004-03-23 18:00:40
652	Purple	4a	10	15	Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if to social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way: If a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace. 
   Further, we provide plenty of means for the mind to refresh itself from business. We celebrate games and sacrifices all the year round, and the elegance of our private establishments forms a daily source of pleasure and helps to banish the spleen; while the magnitude of our city draws the produce of the world into our harbor, so that to the citizen the fruits of other countries are as familiar a luxury as those of his own. 
   If we turn to our military policy, there also we differ from our antagonists. We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien acts exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing, although the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our liberality; trusting less in system and policy than to the native spirit of our citizens; while in education, where our rivals from their very cradles by a painful discipline seek after manliness, here we live exactly as we please, and yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger. So spoke Pericles to the Athenians many centuries before Christ. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:14	1	2004-03-23 18:01:24
653	Purple	4a	12	15	   As one of the world's epoch-making books. Bacon's Essays has done much to mold and direct the character of many individuals. It. almost inevitably challenges comparison with Montaigne's Essays, inasmuch as only some seventeen years separated the publication of the first editions. Bacon lacked Montaigne's lightness of touch and piquant picturesqueness in staling obvious truths so as to make them look like new; while Montaigne, in turn, was entirely destitute of the great English essayist's marvelous penetration into the very soul of things, and of his superb ratiocinative faculty. If Montaigne was the greater literary artist, Bacon was the profounder moral and intellectual force. 
   Bacon's Essays are the work of a man who, in precept at least, had a deep reverence for moral principle. None other than one entertaining such sentiments could have said as he has done: &quot;A man that hath no virtue in himself ever envieth virtue in others&quot;; &quot;Power to do good is the true and lawful end of aspiring, for good thoughts (though God accept them) yet towards men are little better than good dreams, except they be put in act&quot;; and &quot;The desire of power in excess caused the angels to fall; the desire of knowledge in excess caused man to fall; but in charity ( goodness ) there is no excess, neither angel or man come in danger by it.&quot;
   The writer of these Essays was also a man who theoretically cherished a profound love and respect for justice: &quot;The principal duty of a judge is to suppress force and fraud &quot;; &quot;Let no man weakly conceive that just laws and true policy have any antipathy, for they are like the spirits and sinews, that one moves with the other&quot;; and &quot;Suspicions amongst thoughts are like bats amongst birds; they never fly by twilight. They dispose kings to tyranny, husbands to jealousy, wise men to irresolution and melancholy.&quot; 
   Bacon, moreover, always maintains the sanctity of truth alike in scientific investigation and the intercourse of life: &quot;Truth which only doth judge itself, teacheth that the enquiry of truth which is the lovemaking or wooing of it, the knowledge of truth which is the presence of it, and the belief of truth which is the enjoying of it, is the sovereign good of human nature&quot;; or in moral conduct: &quot;It is heaven upon earth to have a man's mind move in charity, rest in providence, and turn upon the poles of truth.&quot; 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:14	1	2004-03-23 18:02:58
654	Purple	4a	13	15	In our population, which is now about 167 million, it is estimated there are more than 33 million people with I.Q.'s below 90; it is a disturbing thought that these people will never, at any age, read much other than comic books, newspaper headlines, and the simplest of bestsellers, nor will they be able to make intelligent judgments on any complicated, important national or international problem. The intellectuals, of course, are at the other end of the scale; they are people with I.Q.'s of 130 or more, and there are slightly more than five million. From 150 to the top of the scale, there are only 2.1 million people. Careful tests have shown that at least half of these high-I.Q. people are never discovered, do not go to college, and live out their lives in humble, even though usually respected, occupations. The identified intellectual, therefore, will at best be only one person in 46, and is more likely to be one person in 150. It is not surprising that he feels a little queer, and is regarded by others as even more so. 
   The fact that there are schisms between groups along the I.Q. scale is an intricate matter. For one thing, the people at any given level show a curious tendency to disapprove of the mental activities of the people at every other level, above or below: The scorn of the highbrow  when he sees a comic-book reader is equal to the contempt of the robust, median-I.Q. football player for the genius who mopes about, reading poetry when he could be getting a good workout in the gym. It is a curious fact that high intelligence is rarely associated with the excess adrenal activity necessary for success in the hard, competitive world of business; the highbrow comes rather low on the pecking order of humans. Each group sublimates its hostility, the intellectual often by writing something cutting about the businessman, the latter by driving a conspicuously more expensive car than the former can afford. 
   A complicating factor is the rise of the mass media of communication television, radio, the movies, and magazines with multimillion circulations. Many observers have pointed out that while all of these, to succeed, must be aimed at the median I.Q the creative efforts involved have to be made at a much higher level; this situation frequently stultifies the creative intelligence of those who earn their livings through mass communication. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:14	1	2004-03-23 18:03:44
655	Purple	4a	14	15	At 5:29:50, as we stood huddled around our radio, we heard a voice ringing through the darkness, sounding as though it had come from above the clouds: &quot;Zero minus ten seconds!&quot; A green flare flashed out through the clouds; descending slowly, it opened, grew dim, and vanished into the darkness. 
   The voice from the clouds boomed out again: &quot;Zero minus three seconds!&quot; Another green flare came down. Silence reigned over the, desert. From the east came the first faint signs of dawn. 
   And just at that instant, there rose from the bowels of the earth a light not of this world; it was the light of many suns in one. It was a sunrise such as the world had never seen  a great, green super-sun climbing in a fraction of a second to a height of more than 8,000 feet, rising ever higher until it touched the clouds, lighting up earth and sky all around with dazzling luminosity. Up it went  a great ball of fire about a mile in diameter, changing colors as it kept shooting upward, from deep purple to orange, expanding, growing bigger, rising as it expanded  an elemental force freed from its bonds after being chained for billions of years. For an instant, the color was an unearthly green, such as one sees only in the corona of the sun during a total eclipse. 
   A great cloud rose from the ground and followed the trail of the great sun. At first it was a giant column; it soon took the shape of a supramundane mushroom. For a fleeting instant, it took the form of the Statue of Liberty magnified many times. Up it went, higher, higher, quivering convulsively. A giant mountain born in a few seconds instead of millions of years, it touched the multicolored clouds, pushed its summit through them, kept rising until it reached a height of 41,000 feet, 12,000 feet higher than the earth's highest mountain.
   It was as though the earth had opened and the skies had split. One felt as though one were present at the moment of creation when God said: &quot;Let there be light.&quot; To one observer. Professor George B. Kistiakowsky of Harvard, the spectacle was &quot;the nearest thing to doomsday that one could possibly imagine.&quot; &quot;I am sure,&quot; he said, &quot;that at the end of the world  in the last millisecond of the earth's existence  the last man will see what we have just seen!&quot; 
   The first atomic bomb had just been successfully detonated. The date: July 16, 1945. The place: Alamagordo Air Base, New Mexico. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:15	1	2004-03-23 18:06:59
656	Purple	4a	15	15	Placing a human being behind the wheel of an automobile often has the same curious effect as cutting certain fibers in the brain. 
   The result in either case is more primitive behavior. Hostile feelings are apt to be expressed in an aggressive way. 
   The same man who will step aside for a stranger at a doorway will, when behind the wheel, risk an accident trying to beat another motorist through an intersection. The importance of emotional factors in automobile accidents is gaining recognition. Doctors and other scientists have concluded that the highway death toll resembles a disease epidemic and should be investigated as such. 
   Dr. Ross A. McFarland, Associate Professor of Industrial Hygiene at the Harvard University School of Public Health, said that accidents &quot;now constitute a greater threat to the safety of large segments of the population than diseases do.&quot;
   Accidents are the leading cause of death between the ages of I and 35. About one third of all accidental deaths and one seventh of all accidental injuries are caused by motor vehicles. 
   Based on the present rate of vehicle registration, unless the accident rate is cut in half, one of every 10 persons in the country will be killed or injured in a traffic accident in the next 15 years.
   Research to find the underlying causes of accidents and to develop ways to detect drivers who are apt to cause them is being conducted at universities and medical centers. Here are some of their findings so far: 
  A man drives as he lives. If he is often in trouble with collection agencies, the courts, and police, chances are he will have repeated automobile accidents. Accident repeaters usually are egocentric, exhibitionistic, resentful of authority, impulsive, and lacking in social responsibility. As a group, they can be classified as borderline psychopathic personalities, according to Dr. McFarland. 
   The suspicion, however, that accident repeaters could be detected in advance by screening out persons with more hostile impulses is false. A study at the University of Colorado showed that there were just as many overly hostile persons among those who had no accidents as among those with repeated accidents.
   Psychologists currently are studying Denver high school pupils to test the validity of this concept. They are making psychological evaluations of the pupils to see whether subsequent driving records will bear out their thesis. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:15	1	2004-03-24 12:34:03
657	Purple	4a	16	15	The conflict between good and evil is a common theme running through the great literature and drama of the world, from the time of the ancient Greeks to the present. The principle that conflict is the heart of all dramatic action, when illustrated by concrete examples, almost always turns up some aspect of the struggle between good and evil.
   The idea that there is neither good nor evil  in any absolute moral or religious sense  is widespread in our times. There are various 
relativistic and behavioristic standards of ethics. If these standards even admit the distinction between good and evil, it is as a relative matter and not as a whirlwind of choices that lies at the center of living. In any such state of mind, conflict can at best be only a petty matter, lacking true universality. The acts of the evildoer and of the virtuous man alike become dramatically neutralized. Imagine the reduced effect of Crime and Punishment or The Brothers Karamazov had Dostoevsky thought that good and evil, as portrayed in those books, were wholly relative, and if he had had no conviction about them.
   You can't have a vital literature if you ignore or shun evil. What you get then is the world of Pollyanna, goody-goody in place of the good. Cry, The Beloved Country is a great and dramatic novel because Alan Paton, in addition to being a skilled workman, sees with clear eyes both good and evil, differentiates them, pitches them into conflict with each other, and takes sides. He sees that the native boy Absalom Kumalo, who has murdered, cannot be judged justly without taking into account the environment that has had part in shaping him. But Paton sees, too, that Absalom the individual, not society the abstraction, committed the act and is responsible for it. Mr. Paton understands mercy. He knows that this precious thing is not evoked by sentimental impulse, but by a searching examination of the realities of human action. Mercy follows a judgment; it does not precede it.
   One of the novels by the talented Paul Bowles, Let It Come Down, is full of motion, full of sensational depravities, and is a crashing bore. The book recognizes no good, admits no evil, and is coldly indifferent to the moral behavior of its characters. It is a long shrug. Such a view of life is nondramatic and negates the vital essence of drama.

658	Purple	4a	17	15	One of the saddest things about the period in which we live is the growing estrangement between America and Europe. This may be a surprising discovery to those who are overimpressed by the speed with which turbojets can hop from New York to Paris. But to anyone who is aware of what America once meant to English libertarian poets and philosophers, to the young Ibsen bitterly excoriating European royalty for the murder of Lincoln, to Italian novelists and poets translating the nineteenth-century American classics as a demonstration against Fascism, there is something particularly disquieting in the way that the European Left, historically &quot;pro-American&quot; because it identified America with expansive democracy, now punishes America with Europe's lack of hope in the future.
   Although America has obviously not fulfilled the visionary hopes entertained for it in the romantic heyday, Americans have, until recently, thought of themselves as an idea, a &quot;proposition&quot; (in Lincoln's word) set up for the enlightenment and improvement of mankind. Officially, we live by our original principles; we insist on this boastfully and even inhumanly. And it is precisely this steadfastness to principle that irks Europeans who under so many pressures have had to shift and to change, to compromise and to retreat.
   Historically, the obstinacy of America's faith in &quot;principles&quot; has been staggering  the sacrament of the Constitution, the legacy of the Founding Fathers) the moral rightness of all our policies, the invincibility of our faith in the equality and perfectibility of man. From the European point of view, there is something impossibly romantic, visionary, and finally outrageous about an attachment to political formulas that arose even before a European revolutionary democracy was born of the French Revolution, and that have survived all the socialist Utopias and Internationals. Americans honestly insist on the equality of men even when they deny this equality in practice; they hold fast to romantic doctrines of perfectibility even when such doctrines contradict their actual or their formal faith  whether it be as scientists or as orthodox Christians. 
   It is a fact that while Americans as a people are notoriously empirical, pragmatic, and unintellectual, they live their lives against a background of unalterable national shibboleths. The same abundance of theory that allowed Walt Whitman to fill out his poetry with philosophical road signs of American optimism allows a president to make pious references to God as an American tradition  references which, despite their somewhat mechanical quality, are not only sincere but which, to most Americans, express the reality of America. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:15	1	2004-03-24 12:57:19
659	Purple	4a	18	15	The two most remarkable things about the musical plays of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II are their seriousness and their success. About their success there can be no doubt. In the spring of 1954, for the first time in the more than ten years since Oklahoma had opened at the St. James Theatre on April 1, 1943, there was no Rodgers and Hammerstein musical on Broadway; the respite was brief, however, for a revival of Carousel was warmly welcomed and held over for an extended summer run. 
   About the final seriousness of these plays there may be some room for disagreement. Certainly, they deal, at least tangentially, with solemn subjects  racial intolerance in South Pacific, international understanding in The King and I, the choice of the life of service over that of luxury in Allegro, unhealthy sexual proclivities in Oklahoma and in Me and Juliet, marital unhappiness in Carousel. There has been so much insistence on the importance of these ideas that they cannot be considered accidental, either to the musical plays or to their success; during its 1953 run in Atlanta, two members of the Georgia state legislature considered the ideational content of South Pacific so important that they proposed the banning of the play because of the song &quot;You've Got To Be Taught,&quot; which suggests that racial intolerance is socially acquired. 
   The commercial success of musicals such as Kismet and Can Can, throwbacks to San Toy and Floradora and sustenance for the now-proverbial tired businessman, indicates that a musical does not have to flirt with serious themes to receive a top rating on the cash register. Yet the reputations of these two hits do not approach that of even the least successful Rodgers and Hammerstein production, Allegro, and the shows themselves do not receive the popular adoration  as against simple attendance  and critical praise bestowed on the Rodgers and Hammerstein pieces. 
   Obviously, Hammerstein has heightened the attractiveness of his musicals by treating ideas that have current popularity as problems. The American who goes into the theater, like the American who goes into the bookstore, unless he is blatantly seeking escape, carries with him an image of himself as an intelligent and reasonably liberal man who is undeniably interested in the problems of his time. The author or the playwright who can indulge him in this picture, without interfering with his entertainment, becomes not simply a successful author, but one who is worthy of great esteem. Thus, a few years ago Sinclair Lewis' melodramatic Kingsblood Royal could become a best-seller, although few of Lewis' readers had the time or the inclination to look at Gunnar Myrdal's gigantic study of the Negro in American society. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:15	1	2004-03-24 12:58:21
660	Purple	4a	19	15	Whatever style television may ultimately compose for itself is now hidden in a primal chaos of all styles, a super-vaudeville large enough to include movies, sports events, grand opera, and news events on the same bill. Until the camera learned to move and to participate in the action, the earliest films were little more than photographic imitations of stage plays, circus tricks, or agitated dumb shows. From this discovery emerged the great motif of the Chase, a motif which is dominant in Chaplin's early comedies. Westerns, cops-and-robbers melodramas, cartoons, etc., and which, in one way or another, figures in almost every kind of film. The Chase was not only a fulfillment of style, but, even more, was a ritual created by a mass psychological need. In the spellbound attention with which the newsreel audience watches a football player running down a broken field and twisting away from hands that clutch at him from all sides, there is, under all the excitement and tension, a release from the common nightmare of being pursued by someone or something which is getting closer and closer. It is almost as though time itself were the pursuer, that is, &quot;cinematic time&quot; ( to use Bergson's appropriate metaphor), conceived as an absolute, free, and mathematical essence with an existence of its own. What better place for the apotheosis of our &quot;cinematic time&quot; than the movies?
   Glowing on the marquee is the name of Benjamin Franklin, appearing as the First American. For his many indigenous qualities, but especially for having made a fetish of time  which is money, everyman's commodity, the stuff of life  Franklin was recognized by Europe as the representative type of a different ethos. During his lifetime, of course, the main outlines of this ethos were still obscure. But by now the American fetishism of time has exposed itself through many nerves of anxiety, e.g., the obsessive dread of losing one's youth or virility, the dread of growing older without &quot;having lived&quot; ( Rip Van Winkle ), the dread of missing one's chance or &quot;golden opportunity,&quot; etc. It is no contradiction, however, that Progress is conceived to be as steady, irresistible, and cumulative a process as the ticking of a clock. The new must be better, for the same reason that the go-getter must come out ahead  or else something is radically wrong. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:15	1	2004-03-24 12:59:17
661	Purple	4a	20	15	A work of literature is a highly complex individual creation, modified by the culture of which it is a part, and by the history of that culture. The simplest lyric is so woven into the human condition through direct reference, through allusion, and through the acceptance or revision of traditional attitudes that no critical act can ever tear it completely loose, add it up, and dispose of it as finished business. The interpretation of literature, even current literature, is a dialectic process that advances by the taking of emphatic positions, which, in turn, prepare for still further countering.
   Nor is the process purely Hegelian; a mistaken turn may cause one to lose ground; and, besides, what critics are trying to illuminate may once, like Hamlet, have been clearer than it will ever be again. This is why you are never through with literature. Something is always being discovered that was never known, or was only half-known, or  misinterpreted, or simply forgotten. And yet there is always available, in varying degrees of clarity, a great body of literature which has proven itself to sensitive readers. 
   The student who gets some inkling of this will understand why many of the questions he has been asking are wrong or premature. He may begin to see that with literature as with his own personality, he is in the presence of the mysterious, and that the clarification of the former cannot be separated from the clarification of the latter. In neither case is complete clarification possible; nevertheless, one must keep driving toward the light; and if he is fortunate enough to move closer to the light, it will be along converging lines that cannot meet on this earth.
   Indeed, one of the important things a student can learn in a literature class is to accept the partial knowledge that it is man's fate to have; and to accept it, not as an invitation to skepticism or despair, but as a condition under which he must work toward a more nearly complete knowledge. It is a liberating experience for students who have been nurtured too rigidly in an atmosphere of certainties to discover that it is possible to exist purposefully, and with such peace of mind as a man needs, in a world where much is doubtful, tentative, and in conflict. 		1	2003-06-07 15:19:16	1	2004-03-24 13:00:55
