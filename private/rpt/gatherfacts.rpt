5	Aqua	2a	2	3	   The snow never melts on some mountains.  And at the North and South poles it stays cold all year.  Over the years snow piles up in these places.  The weight of new snow packs down the old snow.  That turns snow to ice.  The huge sheets of ice are called		1	2002-06-19 13:21:57.000	1	2002-07-18 15:42:06.000
6	Aqua	2a	3	3	   Long ago people lived in caves.  They sat and slept on the ground.  They had no tools, so they had to tear things apart with their hands and crack nuts with their teeth.  Then someone found that a sharp stone would cut.  Someone else saw that a rock wou		1	2002-06-19 13:27:51.000	1	2002-07-18 15:42:06.000

28	Olive	2c	2	5.5	   To young girls, the thimble was once as important as a piece of jewelry.
   In America during the 1700s, thimbles were made by the silversmiths.  Usually they were made to order.  The bands below the tips of the thimbles were fashioned in shades of gol		1	2002-06-20 09:30:23.000	1	2002-06-20 10:59:21.000
